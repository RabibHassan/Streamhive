00:01.958 --> 00:04.249
Why did you stop being a vigilante?

00:04.250 --> 00:05.625
My best friend was killed.

00:08.375 --> 00:09.792
I made a promise to myself.

00:10.542 --> 00:11.833
I'm not him anymore.

00:12.583 --> 00:15.291
<i>You cross into 39th street,
you pay a toll.</i>

00:15.292 --> 00:17.957
<i>Red Hook is exempt
from any taxes, tolls or other payments.</i>

00:17.958 --> 00:19.042
<i>You know that, Luca.</i>

00:19.625 --> 00:21.416
We need cash flow, Matt,
pretty bad.

00:21.417 --> 00:24.666
I'm working on that, too. Already set
meetings with a bunch of banks.

00:24.667 --> 00:27.749
Last night, there was a double homicide
not half a mile from the port.

00:27.750 --> 00:29.916
Silly wee bastard.

00:29.917 --> 00:31.833
Apparently,
a hijacking gone wrong.

00:32.292 --> 00:33.624
I sent Buck to Luca

00:33.625 --> 00:37.542
<i>to tell him to pay Viktor
1.8 restitution for the hijacking.</i>

02:53.000 --> 02:54.499
We got married at City Hall

02:54.500 --> 02:56.791
and now we're opening
a joint checking account.

02:56.792 --> 02:58.416
Girl, come on. It's St. Patrick's Day.

02:58.417 --> 03:00.666
What do you mean you don't wanna
come out for drinks with us?

03:00.667 --> 03:01.749
You watch the game?

03:01.750 --> 03:05.500
Rangers took the Isles to the woodshed
last night. Potvin sucks.

03:06.125 --> 03:07.500
Good morning, Mr. Murdock.

03:08.000 --> 03:11.375
Oh. Mr. Aldrich, thank you so much
for seeing me on such short notice.

03:11.875 --> 03:14.957
Uh, hate to disappoint you,
Mr. Murdock,

03:14.958 --> 03:17.499
but Mr. Aldrich has had a bit
of an emergency this morning.

03:17.500 --> 03:19.416
- Won't be in for a few hours.
- Oh.

03:19.417 --> 03:20.875
- Please, do have a seat.
- Thank you.

03:23.875 --> 03:25.374
I'm Yusuf Khan,

03:25.375 --> 03:28.374
assistant bank manager
here at New York Mutual.

03:28.375 --> 03:30.458
- Thank you so much for waiting.
- No, thank you.

03:31.000 --> 03:34.416
Mr. Aldrich told me to look into
your loan application this morning,

03:34.417 --> 03:35.667
which I've had the...

03:37.167 --> 03:39.250
Not wearing green today, Mr. Murdock?

03:39.667 --> 03:40.708
Green?

03:41.375 --> 03:43.666
- Yeah. Green. Today.
- Oh, I-- I see.

03:43.667 --> 03:47.874
No.
Uh, I tend to prefer more neutral colors.

03:47.875 --> 03:49.416
- Hmm.
- Less likely to clash.

03:49.417 --> 03:52.999
You must be careful, though.
A leprechaun might pinch you.

03:54.917 --> 03:55.917
Candy?

03:57.792 --> 03:59.124
- Uh, no, thank you.
- Okay, all right.

03:59.125 --> 04:01.791
Oops. Excuse me, apologies.

04:01.792 --> 04:03.082
Uh... Ah.

04:03.083 --> 04:05.957
My daughter, Kamala, she's in California.

04:05.958 --> 04:09.541
Visiting some friends there,
La La Land as they say.

04:09.542 --> 04:10.625
Mm. Where's home?

04:11.208 --> 04:12.666
- Jersey City.
- Jersey City.

04:12.667 --> 04:13.749
- Hmm.
- Well,

04:13.750 --> 04:15.457
it certainly has its own special charm.

04:15.458 --> 04:16.708
You think so?

04:17.333 --> 04:18.708
I prefer it to Hoboken.

04:20.125 --> 04:22.832
That's the nicest thing
I've heard anyone say about Jersey City.

04:22.833 --> 04:26.749
People don't know this,
but it used to be the gateway to America.

04:26.750 --> 04:29.833
- Really?
- Yeah. Ellis Island, part of Jersey City.

04:30.500 --> 04:33.916
And our very own superhero, Ms. Marvel.

04:33.917 --> 04:34.999
- Ms. Marvel?
- Mmm-hmm.

04:35.000 --> 04:36.250
I'm not sure I'm familiar.

04:37.708 --> 04:38.708
Hmm?

04:40.583 --> 04:43.207
This is her right here,

04:43.208 --> 04:45.875
a custom-designed Funko in her honor.

04:46.833 --> 04:48.374
- I...
- Oh, yeah. Well, you can't see.

04:48.375 --> 04:49.750
- Yeah.
- But, um...

04:50.708 --> 04:51.707
it's her.

04:51.708 --> 04:52.874
- Is that right?
- Oh, yeah.

04:52.875 --> 04:55.374
Okay. So, shall we?

04:55.375 --> 04:56.667
- Please.
- Your loan.

04:57.500 --> 05:01.416
I can see here that Murdock and McDuffie
plans on expanding rapidly,

05:01.417 --> 05:04.624
hiring new associates,
moving to bigger offices.

05:04.625 --> 05:07.082
Your firm's over-leveraged,

05:07.083 --> 05:08.957
yet you're more than willing to
take on clients

05:08.958 --> 05:10.417
who have a difficult time paying,

05:11.042 --> 05:14.167
- as in the tragic case of White Tiger.
- Mr. Khan, if I may?

05:15.500 --> 05:17.042
Have you ever needed a defense attorney?

05:17.833 --> 05:19.500
Me? No. No, thankfully, not.

05:20.083 --> 05:24.250
Well, if you ever do,
it's often David versus Goliath.

05:25.250 --> 05:27.750
The cops, the prosecution, public opinion,

05:28.542 --> 05:31.832
the entire system conspiring against you.

05:31.833 --> 05:35.042
We represent husbands, sons, daughters,

05:35.792 --> 05:37.292
people like you and me, Mr. Khan.

05:37.833 --> 05:40.750
So yeah, we may be
over-leveraged, for now,

05:41.958 --> 05:46.083
but we serve a vital function in a city
that desperately needs us.

05:50.208 --> 05:54.874
Your compassion and willingness
to take risks are the very qualities

05:54.875 --> 05:57.207
that make you an excellent
defense attorney, Mr. Murdock,

05:57.208 --> 06:01.916
but, unfortunately,
they're the same reasons

06:01.917 --> 06:05.750
that you do not meet
New York Mutual's criteria for approval.

06:07.042 --> 06:09.417
Well, that's certainly
the nicest "no" I've received yet.

06:22.542 --> 06:24.750
Ready then?

06:26.833 --> 06:28.999
Twenty minutes of courage, lads.

06:29.000 --> 06:32.833
Then we got 1.8 mil
and that fat bastard's off Luca's back.

06:33.417 --> 06:36.125
Now... let's have some fun.

06:48.500 --> 06:49.999
AT&T's the worst.

06:51.875 --> 06:53.249
Oh, my God. Run!

06:53.250 --> 06:55.499
Everyone freeze!

06:55.500 --> 06:57.582
Hands in the fucking air!

06:57.583 --> 06:59.749
Hands up. Hands up.

06:59.750 --> 07:01.917
Hands in the air, you silly bastard.

07:02.500 --> 07:04.249
- That's it.
- Hands in the air!

07:04.250 --> 07:06.457
- Get on the floor!
- Didn't do nothin' wrong!

07:06.458 --> 07:08.000
Hey! Don't touch that.

07:17.375 --> 07:18.667
Don't fucking move!

07:19.833 --> 07:21.207
Oh, my God.

07:24.250 --> 07:25.292
- Move.
- I am.

07:28.292 --> 07:30.042
Shit.

07:31.375 --> 07:32.375
Oh, no.

07:33.667 --> 07:34.917
Yeah, it was another no.

07:35.542 --> 07:38.333
I think he said we didn't meet
the bank's loan criteria.

07:39.083 --> 07:41.083
He's a nice enough guy though.

07:41.875 --> 07:43.166
All right, so I'm on my way in now,

07:43.167 --> 07:44.666
I'll probably...

07:44.667 --> 07:46.124
Hold on a sec.

07:46.125 --> 07:48.332
Hands in the air,
you silly bastard.

07:51.083 --> 07:52.125
Kirsten, call 911.

07:53.542 --> 07:55.542
That's it, over here, please. Thank you.

07:56.208 --> 07:58.666
Move. Do you wanna get fucking shot?

07:58.667 --> 07:59.916
- Move!
- Don't hurt us.

07:59.917 --> 08:01.207
Please. Okay. I can--

08:01.208 --> 08:02.999
- Round 'em up, pat 'em down.
- Let's go!

08:03.000 --> 08:04.167
Check the offices.

08:07.583 --> 08:09.291
Oh, come on.

08:09.292 --> 08:12.250
Drop it! Hands up. Move.

08:12.958 --> 08:13.958
Now!

08:16.167 --> 08:17.499
Please don't hurt us.

08:17.500 --> 08:19.375
You think
I'm fucking playing with you?

08:19.917 --> 08:21.291
Okay.

08:21.292 --> 08:22.541
Where do you want me to go?

08:22.542 --> 08:24.417
Try running, I'll shoot you!

08:25.417 --> 08:27.874
AJ. AJ, are you all right? AJ.

08:35.750 --> 08:37.416
Hey! Hey, we got one more.

08:37.417 --> 08:40.000
You! Another step and it'll be your last.

08:40.792 --> 08:42.833
Uh, you talking to me? What's going on?

08:43.458 --> 08:44.999
Can someone
lock the door, please?

08:45.000 --> 08:46.082
Hello?

08:46.083 --> 08:48.124
- Jesus Christ.
- Sorry, what's happening here?

08:48.125 --> 08:50.250
- Right. On your knees, Stevie Wonder.
- I'm on it.

08:51.167 --> 08:52.416
Excuse me.

08:52.417 --> 08:53.582
On your knees!

08:53.583 --> 08:54.791
- Okay.
- Mr. Murdock.

08:54.792 --> 08:56.374
All right. Mr. Khan?

08:56.375 --> 08:58.791
What are you doing here?
I thought you'd already left.

08:58.792 --> 09:00.375
Yeah, I probably should have.

09:21.042 --> 09:24.457
All right!
No need to explain what this is.

09:24.458 --> 09:25.958
You've all been to the movies.

09:26.542 --> 09:28.000
This can go a couple of ways.

09:28.667 --> 09:29.832
You stay where you are,

09:29.833 --> 09:31.832
you keep your heads down,
keep your traps shut,

09:31.833 --> 09:34.749
you stay out of our way
and we'll stay out of yours.

09:34.750 --> 09:37.666
Easy. Everybody goes home

09:37.667 --> 09:40.000
and everybody has a wild story to tell.

09:41.292 --> 09:44.332
Now these weapons are loaded,
they're live,

09:44.333 --> 09:46.042
and they're very, very real.

09:46.750 --> 09:48.249
If anyone has any doubts about that,

09:48.250 --> 09:50.833
feel free to carry on
and find out the hard way.

09:51.458 --> 09:53.207
You kill anyone
and your armed robbery charge

09:53.208 --> 09:54.750
converts to a felony murder.

09:55.500 --> 09:57.125
Then you're looking at 25-to-life.

10:00.750 --> 10:02.625
We have a solicitor on our hands.

10:07.625 --> 10:09.417
Mr. Murdock.

10:10.708 --> 10:12.249
All right then.
Mr. Solicitor here

10:12.250 --> 10:14.582
may not have understood the rules.

10:14.583 --> 10:15.958
Let it be a warning.

10:17.167 --> 10:19.708
Now, where's the bank manager?

10:20.875 --> 10:23.542
I need to see a Mr. Steven Aldrich.

10:26.583 --> 10:29.666
We have a blind man,
do we have a deaf one as well?

10:29.667 --> 10:31.124
I said Steven Aldrich,

10:31.125 --> 10:33.333
come out, come out wherever you are,
please, Steven.

10:49.292 --> 10:51.332
<i>10-Charlie,
request road closure</i>

10:51.333 --> 10:53.042
<i>10 block northeast heading south.</i>

10:55.958 --> 10:57.499
- The cops are here.
- Shit.

10:57.500 --> 10:58.958
You gotta be fucking kidding me.

10:59.875 --> 11:02.249
The manager.
Now or we start shooting.

11:02.250 --> 11:04.874
I don't think the manager's here.
Please don't shoot us.

11:04.875 --> 11:07.208
Please. Please.

11:11.083 --> 11:12.083
You.

11:13.125 --> 11:14.875
Me? Uh...

11:16.250 --> 11:17.917
- What's your name?
- Um, uh...

11:19.333 --> 11:20.542
Yusuf Khan, sir.

11:22.500 --> 11:24.624
- You work here, right?
- Yes, sir.

11:24.625 --> 11:26.541
What's your title, Yusuf Khan?

11:26.542 --> 11:27.625
Title? Uh...

11:28.500 --> 11:30.582
Assistant Bank Manager. Assistant.

11:30.583 --> 11:32.832
- Assistant Bank Manager.
- That's right, sir.

11:32.833 --> 11:35.083
Where's the non-assistant bank manager?

11:35.708 --> 11:38.749
Actually, he... He's had a bit
of an emergency this morning.

11:38.750 --> 11:40.624
He won't be in for a couple of hours.

11:40.625 --> 11:41.957
- A couple of hours?
- Yeah.

11:41.958 --> 11:43.250
Shut it.

11:44.833 --> 11:45.832
Yusuf Khan.

11:45.833 --> 11:46.917
Yes, sir.

11:48.833 --> 11:50.042
You're gonna open the vault.

11:51.000 --> 11:52.583
Can you do that for me, Yusuf Khan?

11:56.083 --> 11:58.250
- Yeah, yes, sir.
- Good man.

12:02.917 --> 12:04.417
- SWAT's pulling up.
- SWAT?

12:07.708 --> 12:09.416
Stay fluid, all right? Courage.

12:09.417 --> 12:10.583
We talked about this.

12:11.333 --> 12:15.000
Nothing changes.
They do them. We do us.

12:17.917 --> 12:19.457
All right. Looks like we're gonna be

12:19.458 --> 12:21.707
spending a little more time together
than we thought.

12:21.708 --> 12:23.666
This isn't a fucking party.

12:23.667 --> 12:26.457
The less you know about us,
the less we know about you.

12:26.458 --> 12:28.957
Let's keep it that way. Faces down.

12:37.500 --> 12:39.207
How the hell
did they get here so fast?

12:39.208 --> 12:41.416
Someone must have triggered the alarm
before we got in.

12:41.417 --> 12:43.791
Before we got in?
How could they have known we were comin'--

12:43.792 --> 12:45.707
Hey. None of that matters.

12:45.708 --> 12:47.582
Eyes on the prize. Right?

12:47.583 --> 12:49.999
We do what the boss told us to do.

12:50.000 --> 12:51.457
And we go to Plan B.

12:51.458 --> 12:53.625
- Plan B.
- All right.

12:54.708 --> 12:56.041
You stay with the hostages,

12:56.042 --> 12:57.249
I'll handle the cops.

12:57.250 --> 13:00.624
Blue takes the assistant manager
downstairs to open the vault.

13:03.917 --> 13:05.458
You can't open it, can you?

13:07.208 --> 13:08.958
The vault.

13:10.958 --> 13:13.249
- Look, I didn't know what to say, okay?
- It's okay.

13:13.250 --> 13:14.332
I... I just panicked.

13:14.333 --> 13:16.166
I thought he was going...

13:16.167 --> 13:17.749
Probably I should just tell him, right?

13:17.750 --> 13:20.791
No. Not now. He won't believe you.
He'll think you're bluffing.

13:20.792 --> 13:21.875
Oh.

13:23.000 --> 13:24.332
Where is it?

13:24.333 --> 13:25.750
- Four floors below.
- Okay.

13:27.667 --> 13:29.500
All right. When he takes you down there,

13:30.167 --> 13:33.000
you stall as long as you can, okay?
Can you do that?

13:34.333 --> 13:35.917
What did I tell you?

13:38.042 --> 13:40.042
- Get up there and find an approach.
- Yes, sir.

13:43.958 --> 13:45.042
Rodriguez?

13:46.708 --> 13:48.582
- Who are you?
- Detective Angie Kim.

13:48.583 --> 13:50.999
- What happened to Murphy?
- You know what today is?

13:51.000 --> 13:53.749
You know that half of force is face down
in a pool of Guinness by now.

13:53.750 --> 13:57.124
I'm the acting deputy hostage negotiator,
5th Precinct.

13:57.125 --> 13:58.832
You got a status report for me?

13:58.833 --> 14:00.999
Call came in at 9:14 a.m.

14:01.000 --> 14:02.957
Security feed showed 20 civilians.

14:02.958 --> 14:06.499
By 9:15, every camera and line
of communication in the bank went down.

14:06.500 --> 14:08.042
- Any contact?
- Not yet.

14:09.250 --> 14:10.250
Captain.

14:11.333 --> 14:13.917
Whoa, whoa, whoa! Hey! Back.

14:15.250 --> 14:16.374
'Scuse me, sir, behind...

14:16.375 --> 14:17.583
Someone's ears were burning.

14:19.625 --> 14:20.749
This is Detective Kim.

14:20.750 --> 14:22.999
Whom do I have the pleasure
of speaking with?

14:23.000 --> 14:24.082
<i>"Whom"?</i>

14:24.083 --> 14:26.083
Elocution off the top.

14:26.875 --> 14:30.749
Very impressive, detective.
Detective Kim, was it?

14:30.750 --> 14:32.792
Angie Kim, officer-in-command.

14:33.292 --> 14:37.166
Well, lucky for me then.
You can just call me Jesse James, yeah?

14:37.167 --> 14:40.541
Good one. How's your morning
going so far, Mr. James?

14:40.542 --> 14:42.624
<i>Well, just peachy, Detective. And you?</i>

14:42.625 --> 14:45.416
You picked a heck of a day
to take over a bank.

14:45.417 --> 14:48.166
Wanna come out and raise a pint with me?
Lots of Guinness out here.

14:50.292 --> 14:52.500
That does sound temptin', Detective.

14:53.750 --> 14:56.083
And you do sound calm, don't you?

14:56.958 --> 14:59.000
Calm, firm, and resolute,

15:00.000 --> 15:01.874
<i>just like the manual says.</i>

15:01.875 --> 15:05.624
I didn't know the NYPD manual
was available in Belfast.

15:05.625 --> 15:07.291
<i>That's good.</i>

15:07.292 --> 15:10.624
But your cops around the world
are all pretty much the same, aren't they?

15:10.625 --> 15:13.416
Next, you'll be trying to establish
the upper hand, won't you?

15:13.417 --> 15:15.707
Except in this case,
I'm not sure I have to try.

15:15.708 --> 15:17.541
You're surrounded, Mr. James.

15:17.542 --> 15:21.041
Only way this ends is with you
in handcuffs or a body bag.

15:21.042 --> 15:23.083
Let's try to avoid the latter then,
shall we?

15:23.833 --> 15:25.749
<i>Nothing would make me happier.</i>

15:25.750 --> 15:26.833
Good.

15:27.833 --> 15:30.082
Let's start with three armored APVs then.

15:30.083 --> 15:31.791
<i>Parked right out front.</i>

15:31.792 --> 15:34.124
You sure you'll be needing
that many seats?

15:34.125 --> 15:36.957
From what I understand,
your crew isn't that big.

15:36.958 --> 15:38.042
<i>Detective Kim.</i>

15:39.208 --> 15:40.250
<i>Yes?</i>

15:40.833 --> 15:44.917
My job is to rob the bank. Right?

15:46.833 --> 15:50.749
Your job is to prevent
every hostage inside the bank

15:50.750 --> 15:53.332
from getting a fucking bullet
to the fucking head.

16:02.958 --> 16:04.250
You have until 9:45.

16:06.000 --> 16:07.417
That's less than 30 minutes.

16:08.042 --> 16:09.042
<i>And?</i>

16:12.208 --> 16:13.750
I need something from you.

16:14.625 --> 16:17.208
Give me two hostages,
as a sign of good faith.

16:19.375 --> 16:20.375
What's the move?

16:21.250 --> 16:24.792
Let 'em think they're in control,
just like the boss says.

16:28.875 --> 16:32.041
Okay, okay, okay.

16:35.083 --> 16:37.167
It's okay. It's all right.

16:37.792 --> 16:40.083
Don't mind the gun.

16:42.125 --> 16:43.667
Who shall we choose?

16:48.000 --> 16:49.000
You.

16:49.958 --> 16:51.000
Up.

16:52.333 --> 16:54.417
Up, come on. On your feet.

16:55.542 --> 16:57.082
Solicitor, up.

16:57.083 --> 16:58.624
- Please.
- Both of ya.

16:58.625 --> 17:00.207
Please, just don't hurt her.

17:00.208 --> 17:01.750
Please. Just don't hurt her. Please.

17:06.208 --> 17:09.207
Congratulations, you've both
been emancipated.

17:11.167 --> 17:12.499
- Honey. Honey, go.
- But...

17:12.500 --> 17:15.332
- My husband. We just got married.
- Honey, get out of here. Look at me.

17:15.333 --> 17:18.416
- Please. Please.
- Go, please. Honey, just look at me. Go.

17:18.417 --> 17:19.500
Please.

17:20.250 --> 17:21.375
Let him take my place.

17:23.250 --> 17:24.250
Sorry?

17:24.833 --> 17:26.083
I said let him take my place.

17:29.458 --> 17:32.874
This isn't a debate, Solicitor,
but thank you for the suggestion.

17:32.875 --> 17:35.083
Just 'cause I'm blind
doesn't mean I need your pity.

17:37.042 --> 17:40.541
Do I strike you as some sanctimonious twat

17:40.542 --> 17:44.333
tryin' to do right
by the visually impaired, do I?

17:46.792 --> 17:49.167
I don't like you, Solicitor.

17:49.833 --> 17:51.249
I don't like your kind.

17:51.250 --> 17:54.167
I don't like the clever little ways
you twist the truth.

17:55.542 --> 17:58.582
I'm not letting you go,
I'm getting rid of ya.

17:58.583 --> 18:00.125
That's understandable.

18:00.833 --> 18:04.582
All I know is you're offering me a chance
to save myself, which I appreciate.

18:04.583 --> 18:07.875
What I'm saying to you is,
give it to the woman's husband.

18:08.542 --> 18:09.917
Is that what you're sayin' to me?

18:13.125 --> 18:14.125
What's your name?

18:15.042 --> 18:16.541
Matthew Murdock.

18:16.542 --> 18:17.832
Murdock?

18:17.833 --> 18:19.374
Oh, Jesus Christ.

18:19.375 --> 18:22.166
Not just a blind solicitor
with a martyr complex

18:22.167 --> 18:24.124
but an Irishman.

18:24.125 --> 18:25.999
Where's your family from then,
Mr. Murdock?

18:26.000 --> 18:30.416
Hell's Kitchen.
Do you hear that, lads? Hell's Kitchen.

18:30.417 --> 18:32.541
Before the big swim, Mr. Smartass.

18:32.542 --> 18:34.041
I don't know.

18:34.042 --> 18:35.625
I was raised in an orphanage.

18:36.958 --> 18:39.792
Jesus wept. I, uh...

18:41.333 --> 18:44.500
A blind solicitor and,
hold for it, an orphan?

18:45.667 --> 18:47.791
Are you bloody serious?

18:47.792 --> 18:50.500
You're like a regular wee
Charles Dickens character, aren't you?

18:56.333 --> 18:59.416
Fuck it. Take the husband.
This one's gotta stay.

18:59.417 --> 19:02.917
- Oh, God. Thank you. Thank you.
- Unlock it, let 'em out.

19:07.292 --> 19:10.292
Careful what you wish for, Mr. Murdock.

19:12.250 --> 19:13.499
Khan!

19:13.500 --> 19:15.042
- Sir?
- On your feet.

19:20.125 --> 19:21.124
You're up.

19:21.125 --> 19:22.667
Understand? Move.

19:30.125 --> 19:31.417
Movement. Positions.

19:32.042 --> 19:33.499
Shield Team, up!

19:33.500 --> 19:34.832
Guys, let's fucking go.

19:34.833 --> 19:36.957
Why don't you
let us through first.

19:36.958 --> 19:38.125
All right. Go.

19:39.250 --> 19:40.500
Guy can't do nothing.

19:41.417 --> 19:43.707
Move. Move, move, move.

19:43.708 --> 19:45.291
Hey! Hey, what are you doing?

19:45.292 --> 19:46.542
Hey! What are you doing?

19:48.292 --> 19:49.333
Move it already.

19:52.208 --> 19:55.874
All of this BS just for
the friggin' vault? Get outta here.

19:55.875 --> 20:00.125
They're not gonna find any cash in there.
It's just a bunch of safety deposit boxes.

20:02.708 --> 20:03.750
How'd you know that?

20:04.958 --> 20:07.792
My family's been banking here
since they got off the boat.

20:08.542 --> 20:11.333
I got my grandmother's ring in there,
some other heirlooms,

20:12.125 --> 20:15.500
and I got a 1994 Mark Messier signed puck.

20:16.042 --> 20:18.249
It's probably the most valuable item
in this bank.

20:20.958 --> 20:21.999
Rangers fan, huh?

20:22.000 --> 20:24.666
Rangers, Jets, Mets, baby. All day.

20:24.667 --> 20:27.292
I bet it's diamonds.
What else would they be after?

20:29.250 --> 20:32.166
Hey, man, I know what you did
was really beautiful,

20:32.167 --> 20:34.832
but maybe you could just sit down,
so we don't all get in trouble.

20:34.833 --> 20:37.624
Hey. What are you still
doing on your feet?

20:37.625 --> 20:39.541
What's going on here? On your knees.

20:39.542 --> 20:41.125
I'm sorry, guys, I need to go.

20:41.792 --> 20:43.707
Should've taken your chance
when you had it, Stevie.

20:43.708 --> 20:46.167
No. No, no, no.
To the restroom.

20:50.083 --> 20:51.375
Anyone else for the loo?

20:56.833 --> 20:58.917
Tell him I'm taking
the solicitor here to the gents.

21:04.167 --> 21:06.000
You feel that? Aye?

21:07.333 --> 21:08.333
Mmm-hmm.

21:09.458 --> 21:10.792
Good.

21:12.625 --> 21:14.542
Just making sure
we understand each other.

21:16.292 --> 21:17.292
Move.

21:22.625 --> 21:26.917
Did you know that New York Mutual
was built in 1931?

21:27.583 --> 21:30.916
This vault here, uh, was built first

21:30.917 --> 21:33.707
and the bank was then
constructed around it.

21:33.708 --> 21:35.082
What are you, the bank historian?

21:35.083 --> 21:36.250
Left.

21:37.000 --> 21:40.166
But did you know
that this door of the vault was--

21:40.167 --> 21:43.000
This is actually over 2,000 kilos.

21:44.583 --> 21:47.083
There's a door on your left. Move.

21:49.250 --> 21:50.292
Open it.

21:53.333 --> 21:54.333
Stairs.

21:58.833 --> 21:59.917
Hurry up.

22:05.208 --> 22:08.166
Bloody open it, before I shove this
down your throat, yeah?

22:08.167 --> 22:11.208
Please. Please, sir, I-- I have family.

22:11.917 --> 22:12.916
Now.

22:12.917 --> 22:14.333
- Please.
- Hurry up.

22:39.542 --> 22:43.249
Actually, could I please request
if you could get me a snack?

22:43.250 --> 22:47.374
Just a granola bar or maybe a banana,
would work wonders for my nerves.

22:47.375 --> 22:49.374
You want to see that family of yours?

22:49.375 --> 22:52.124
Open the bloody door.

23:08.875 --> 23:11.207
- Then bloody open it.
- Uh...

23:11.208 --> 23:13.832
Wait. Um, have we passed
the first of the month already?

23:13.833 --> 23:16.916
Because the bank changes
the combination of the vault

23:16.917 --> 23:19.166
on the first Tuesday of every month.

23:19.167 --> 23:20.832
- What day of the week are we in--
- Enough!

23:20.833 --> 23:23.082
Please! Please, please. Don't shoot me.

23:23.083 --> 23:25.624
You've been lying to us
this whole time, haven't ya?

23:25.625 --> 23:29.791
If you know the correct combination,
then I'm the bloody King of England.

23:34.833 --> 23:36.917
Mr. Murdock.

23:37.458 --> 23:39.499
<i>What's your status?</i>

23:39.500 --> 23:40.583
Pass it to me.

23:42.542 --> 23:44.292
What's your status, lads?

23:45.500 --> 23:46.667
- What are you--
- We're just...

23:49.000 --> 23:50.125
Um...

23:51.042 --> 23:52.541
I needed
the bank manager

23:52.542 --> 23:54.832
to be sufficiently motivated
to open the vault.

23:54.833 --> 23:56.583
He is now. We're almost in.

24:00.167 --> 24:01.708
Why are you talking to me, then?

24:02.625 --> 24:04.499
Hey, watch out.

24:11.833 --> 24:13.833
Mr. Murdock, what are you doing?

24:14.667 --> 24:17.624
There are three men with automatic weapons
trained on the hostages upstairs.

24:17.625 --> 24:19.375
We can't go back up empty-handed.

24:19.958 --> 24:23.082
Whatever is behind this door
will buy us some time

24:23.083 --> 24:24.749
and keep the other folks safe.

24:24.750 --> 24:27.000
So, let them think they're in control.

24:29.708 --> 24:32.207
This vault has a four-turn tumbler system,

24:32.208 --> 24:35.375
which means it has over
100 million possible combinations.

24:37.250 --> 24:40.249
You can't just crack it open
like it's a piggy bank I gave Kamala

24:40.250 --> 24:42.583
to instill in her the value of saving.

24:45.250 --> 24:47.124
Did it work?

24:47.125 --> 24:48.292
Did what work?

24:52.208 --> 24:55.375
The lesson? The value of saving?

24:56.208 --> 24:58.583
Oh. I don't know.

24:59.292 --> 25:02.542
I guess, we just try to impart
what we know to the next generation,

25:04.125 --> 25:06.458
protect them from what they can't see.

25:27.583 --> 25:29.499
Exactly what kind of a lawyer are you?

25:29.500 --> 25:32.125
A really good one.

25:36.000 --> 25:37.541
<i>Well, how are we doing</i>

25:37.542 --> 25:39.957
<i>with our esteemed
transportation department?</i>

25:39.958 --> 25:42.332
Do you have any idea
how many streets are blocked off today?

25:42.333 --> 25:44.166
Getting anything into
the financial district

25:44.167 --> 25:45.874
is a logistical nightmare.

25:45.875 --> 25:48.749
And cue the part where the negotiator
pleads for more time, is it?

25:48.750 --> 25:52.207
Does it sound like I'm pleading?
I am telling you, we need another hour.

25:52.208 --> 25:53.999
They'll get here.
They just need more time.

25:54.000 --> 25:55.082
It is what it is.

25:55.083 --> 25:56.791
<i>Qué será, será,</i> Detective?

25:56.792 --> 25:59.499
Is that how we do things now at the NYPD?

25:59.500 --> 26:00.749
You'll get your APVs,

26:00.750 --> 26:04.207
everyone lives to celebrate
another St. Patrick's Day.

26:04.208 --> 26:07.999
Oi. I confess.
I'm disappointed, Detective.

26:08.000 --> 26:10.957
You recognized the accent,
but you don't seem to know jack shite

26:10.958 --> 26:13.458
about the significance of St. Paddy's Day

26:14.375 --> 26:16.124
for a Protestant, do you?

26:16.125 --> 26:18.041
I must have missed that chapter,
Mr. James.

26:18.042 --> 26:19.166
<i>Care to catch me up?</i>

26:19.167 --> 26:20.708
Just another Wednesday, love.

26:21.458 --> 26:24.041
Or as they say in this dear city of yours,

26:24.042 --> 26:25.458
"Christmas for a Jew."

26:26.083 --> 26:30.167
Otherwise, you and I might be
sharing that pint...

26:31.375 --> 26:32.375
right now.

26:37.417 --> 26:38.708
Let's make this interesting.

26:39.417 --> 26:42.582
<i>You'll have exactly three minutes
to think of a joke.</i>

26:42.583 --> 26:44.167
If you can make me laugh...

26:45.333 --> 26:46.583
I'll give you three more.

26:48.792 --> 26:49.792
Hey.

26:51.208 --> 26:52.500
Who knows a good joke?

26:54.542 --> 26:56.708
It's just safety deposit boxes?

26:57.333 --> 27:00.042
One thousand, two hundred
and seventy-three of them.

27:01.417 --> 27:02.667
And they all require a key?

27:03.667 --> 27:04.917
Two, to be precise.

27:05.708 --> 27:09.125
One, the banker's,
second one, the owner's.

27:11.083 --> 27:12.583
So then, what are they...

27:22.667 --> 27:24.250
Um...

27:25.625 --> 27:26.916
Maybe we could just...

27:26.917 --> 27:28.499
Must be our lucky day.

27:28.500 --> 27:30.583
You're telling me
none of you know a good joke?

27:31.208 --> 27:34.250
And action.

27:35.583 --> 27:36.624
Okay.

27:36.625 --> 27:42.249
So, uh, a priest finds a four-leaf clover
on the hills of Donegal.

27:42.250 --> 27:44.416
An Irish joke? Really?

27:44.417 --> 27:46.042
Check to see if there's a number on it.

27:46.833 --> 27:50.333
It's been erased,
but I can vaguely see a four.

27:51.875 --> 27:52.875
Start there.

27:54.708 --> 27:58.124
<i>Priest rubs the four-leaf clover
and out pops a leprechaun.</i>

27:58.125 --> 28:01.582
Uh, priest is ecstatic.
He thinks, "This must be my lucky day!"

28:01.583 --> 28:03.374
That the leprechaun now owes him a wish,

28:03.375 --> 28:06.249
but, uh, before the priest
can utter a word,

28:06.250 --> 28:07.749
<i>the leprechaun asks him,</i>

28:07.750 --> 28:10.166
"Father,
do you by any chance

28:10.167 --> 28:12.707
"have a leprechaun nun
in your congregation?"

28:12.708 --> 28:16.541
Bravo, Detective.
10 out of 10 on the accent.

28:17.917 --> 28:21.041
So, the priest says,
"Hate to break it to you, sonny,

28:21.042 --> 28:25.833
"but there's no such thing in this world
or the next as a leprechaun nun."

28:26.417 --> 28:30.957
<i>The leprechaun
shakes his head, confused, forlorn.</i>

28:30.958 --> 28:34.957
"Ah, blimey!" he says,
"I just fucked a penguin."

28:49.625 --> 28:52.708
You have exactly 10 minutes
before I shoot the first hostage.

28:56.292 --> 28:59.124
So, was it true what you said upstairs,
Mr. Murdock?

28:59.125 --> 29:00.707
About being an orphan?

29:00.708 --> 29:03.541
Mmm-hmm. My father died
when I was just a boy.

29:03.542 --> 29:06.207
I never knew my mother
until much later in life.

29:06.208 --> 29:08.667
I-- I'm sorry.
That must have been difficult.

29:09.375 --> 29:10.874
No need to apologize, Mr. Khan.

29:13.208 --> 29:16.916
I'm sorry. I'm just out of sorts here.

29:16.917 --> 29:19.374
Hey. You're doing great.

29:19.375 --> 29:21.666
We're almost there.
We're gonna make it out of here.

29:21.667 --> 29:23.542
You're gonna see your daughter again.

29:28.417 --> 29:29.625
<i>Inshallah.</i>

29:34.333 --> 29:35.500
We got a winner.

29:48.500 --> 29:49.750
A jewelry pouch.

29:57.375 --> 29:58.542
Wow.

30:00.500 --> 30:02.417
That's one impressive diamond.

30:03.042 --> 30:04.249
May I hold it?

30:04.250 --> 30:05.333
Sure.

30:06.667 --> 30:09.832
It's a pretty high-end stone
for a bunch of rough Irish robbers.

30:09.833 --> 30:13.375
Well, I heard the leader mention a boss.
I think they're working for someone.

30:14.500 --> 30:15.500
Oh.

30:21.667 --> 30:23.666
Clock's up
on the fun and games, Detective.

30:23.667 --> 30:25.791
It's time to go in.
Fan 'em out.

30:25.792 --> 30:27.874
Tell them to take up
positions on the perimeter.

30:27.875 --> 30:29.457
Captain, you storm that bank right now,

30:29.458 --> 30:31.374
innocent people will be
caught in the crossfire.

30:31.375 --> 30:33.583
Innocent people are already
caught in the crossfire.

30:34.583 --> 30:35.750
Prepare to advance.

30:37.083 --> 30:38.750
- We need to get upstairs. Let's go.
- Okay.

30:40.917 --> 30:42.833
What is taking so long?

30:44.083 --> 30:45.292
Christ.

30:47.625 --> 30:48.666
Where's the blind one?

30:48.667 --> 30:51.333
I don't know. He's not back yet.
I don't like this.

30:52.542 --> 30:53.541
Behind ya.

30:53.542 --> 30:55.708
Stop right there!

30:56.292 --> 30:58.124
How the hell did you get up here?

30:58.125 --> 30:59.875
You're asking the wrong question.

31:01.083 --> 31:03.499
You're running out of time.
You need to think about your next move.

31:03.500 --> 31:05.999
Hands up! Both of you. Now!

31:06.000 --> 31:09.916
No. You let these people go, now,
while you still can.

31:09.917 --> 31:11.124
What are you talking about?

31:11.125 --> 31:13.500
When was the last time you spoke
to the hostage negotiator?

31:14.417 --> 31:15.999
Been a while? Right?

31:16.000 --> 31:18.042
That's 'cause the police
are no longer negotiating.

31:20.458 --> 31:24.666
Well then, Solicitor,
maybe I need to convince them I'm serious.

31:24.667 --> 31:25.749
Oh, no!

31:28.458 --> 31:31.000
You and I both know
you didn't come here to kill anybody.

31:32.292 --> 31:33.583
You came here looking for this.

31:36.167 --> 31:38.042
How the hell did you get that?

31:39.083 --> 31:40.417
It was on one of your men.

31:42.750 --> 31:44.291
We go on my count.

31:44.292 --> 31:46.999
- Move it. Go! Go, go!
- 10...

31:47.000 --> 31:51.250
Nine... Eight... Seven...

31:52.292 --> 31:54.332
Now, let these people go.

31:54.333 --> 31:56.333
I'll give you the diamond. Everybody wins.

31:56.917 --> 31:59.249
Six... Five...

31:59.250 --> 32:01.332
Or I just shoot you
in the head...

32:01.333 --> 32:02.666
- Four...
- ...and take it from you.

32:02.667 --> 32:03.916
You have no leverage, son.

32:03.917 --> 32:05.416
You have no time.

32:05.417 --> 32:07.166
I'm going to give you
three seconds

32:07.167 --> 32:09.332
before I put a bullet in your head.

32:09.333 --> 32:10.832
Three...

32:10.833 --> 32:11.917
Two...

32:12.333 --> 32:13.708
- One.
- Here. Catch.

32:19.583 --> 32:20.707
Go, go, go!

32:20.708 --> 32:21.916
On the ground! Now!

32:21.917 --> 32:23.457
- Go! Go!
- Hands up!

32:23.458 --> 32:26.041
- Okay. Hey!
- Guns down, hands up!

32:27.792 --> 32:29.624
- Hands up!
- Get on the ground!

32:29.625 --> 32:31.249
Now! Hands in the air!

32:31.250 --> 32:33.583
Show your hands!
Show your hands!

32:36.208 --> 32:38.249
Guns down! Hands up!

32:38.250 --> 32:40.542
On the ground! On the ground!

32:45.625 --> 32:48.124
Drop your weapon!
Hands in the air.

32:48.125 --> 32:50.916
Show your hands!
Show your hands! Show your hands!

32:50.917 --> 32:52.250
Come on, come on!

32:53.750 --> 32:55.000
Wait, wait.

33:03.167 --> 33:04.167
Daddy.

33:12.375 --> 33:15.292
Get this to Luca.

33:32.583 --> 33:33.583
Listen up!

33:34.250 --> 33:35.541
If you are a hostage

33:35.542 --> 33:37.666
- and haven't given a statement yet...
- Hold it. Hold it!

33:37.667 --> 33:40.207
Who's that?
Oh, I-- I need to see the medic.

33:40.208 --> 33:42.542
This guy was a hostage. He's with us.

33:43.375 --> 33:45.124
Yeah. Bottom of the steps.

33:45.125 --> 33:46.458
Thank you, sir.

33:47.875 --> 33:50.583
Sir, right through here.

34:10.958 --> 34:12.416

The police told me
they never found the diamond.

35:24.292 --> 35:25.874
The lead robber didn't have it.

35:25.875 --> 35:28.250
- Stop! I told you to knock it off.
- None of the robbers did.

35:29.500 --> 35:30.832
What do you think happened?

35:30.833 --> 35:32.458
I think you were right.

35:33.083 --> 35:34.542
They must have had a boss.

35:35.292 --> 35:36.791
Someone inside the bank.

35:36.792 --> 35:38.000
Very strange.

35:39.042 --> 35:41.416
Still, I always believe
things happen for a reason.

35:41.417 --> 35:44.874
If this is about us reconsidering
your loan, Mr. Murdock--

35:44.875 --> 35:46.707
I didn't come here
about the loan,

35:46.708 --> 35:48.458
I just came here to check on you.

35:49.125 --> 35:51.917
Oh. Good. Thank you.

35:52.667 --> 35:54.000
But you know what?

35:54.708 --> 35:58.999
Perhaps we can brainstorm on ways
to make your firm more profitable,

35:59.000 --> 36:01.749
over dinner? With my family?

36:01.750 --> 36:03.332
I'd like that very much.

36:03.333 --> 36:05.582
As long as it involves a trip
to Jersey City, Mr. Khan.

36:05.583 --> 36:10.666
Great. It's a plan then.
And please, call me Yusuf.

36:10.667 --> 36:13.041
You know, my wife, Muneeba,

36:13.042 --> 36:17.207
she makes the most delicious
fresh parathas.

36:17.208 --> 36:18.666
And my daughter--

36:18.667 --> 36:20.083
Ah! The famous Kamala.

36:20.917 --> 36:22.874
Yes. Kamala.

36:22.875 --> 36:24.166
Okay, great.

36:24.167 --> 36:25.999
I will see you at dinner, then,
Mr. Murdock.

36:26.000 --> 36:27.167
Please. Matthew.

36:28.125 --> 36:29.249
Matthew.

36:29.250 --> 36:32.166
You know,
I think I'm gonna try one of these.

36:32.167 --> 36:34.083
You must.

36:37.417 --> 36:38.583
- Mmm!
- Mmm-hmm.
