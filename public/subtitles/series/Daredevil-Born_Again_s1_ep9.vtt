WEBVTT

00:02.375 --> 00:04.666
We put Poindexter away
and it changes nothing.

00:04.667 --> 00:07.499
We defend Hector Ayala
and he's still murdered.

00:07.500 --> 00:09.791
Heather's assaulted by Muse
and she thinks Fisk is right.

00:09.792 --> 00:13.208
This, us, what... what we do,
it feels useless.

00:15.917 --> 00:17.874
It occurs to me that justice

00:17.875 --> 00:19.207
will not be served today,

00:19.208 --> 00:22.082
because whatever sentence is passed,
Foggy Nelson will still be dead.

00:22.083 --> 00:23.791
What're you gonna do
about Daredevil?

00:23.792 --> 00:26.750
I'm not him anymore.
And I won't let myself be.

00:28.458 --> 00:29.749
A client of mine was shot.

00:29.750 --> 00:32.416
Guess whose logo I found
on the bullet casing?

00:32.417 --> 00:34.791
A task force. Hand-picked by me.

00:34.792 --> 00:36.541
This is every bad apple
in the barrel.

00:36.542 --> 00:38.457
I prefer "motivated individuals."

00:38.458 --> 00:39.582
He was celebrating.

00:39.583 --> 00:42.666
Foggy knew the night he died he was
gonna win, and somebody silenced him.

00:42.667 --> 00:45.082
Everyone thought you were just a shooter
on a rampage.

00:45.083 --> 00:46.332
You did it for Fisk.

00:46.333 --> 00:47.749
I took over the business.

00:47.750 --> 00:50.874
Then he returns
and I really don't know how I feel.

00:50.875 --> 00:53.874
But I need you to know,
he sought you out to get to me.

00:53.875 --> 00:56.416
Matt, you're starting to worry me
on a professional level.

00:56.417 --> 00:58.082
Ben Poindexter killed
a prison guard

00:58.083 --> 00:59.292
and used his badge to escape.

01:00.292 --> 01:01.749
I know you had Foggy killed.

01:01.750 --> 01:03.249
Your husband, does he know?

01:20.042 --> 01:25.208
- ♪ I see the lightning flashing ♪
- ♪ I see the lightning flashing ♪

01:26.208 --> 01:30.957
- ♪ Heard ♪
- ♪ Heard the thunder roll ♪

01:52.417 --> 01:55.833
The whole FBI corruption scandal,
Agent Nadeem, all that.

01:56.875 --> 01:58.750
It's why my husband was acquitted.

01:59.792 --> 02:01.958
It's only fair it should benefit you, too.

02:03.625 --> 02:06.375
"Release on appeal."

02:11.208 --> 02:12.208
Fisk,

02:13.333 --> 02:14.750
he knows about this?

02:15.750 --> 02:18.583
I haven't seen my husband in a while.

02:19.917 --> 02:23.042
I had you released because I need a favor.

02:24.958 --> 02:26.167
You want me to...

02:28.667 --> 02:29.792
kill someone.

02:31.708 --> 02:34.833
A thief called Benjamin Cafaro

02:35.875 --> 02:38.000
and his lawyer, Foggy Nelson.

02:40.542 --> 02:42.000
I remember him.

02:43.208 --> 02:45.208
Escape the past, do we?

02:45.958 --> 02:48.708
The case he's involved with
would shine

02:49.417 --> 02:52.458
unwanted light
on some of my business practices.

02:55.000 --> 02:56.750
It has to be soon.

02:57.875 --> 02:59.333
In the next few days.

03:00.375 --> 03:02.667
Dr. Jane,
seven-five-three-three.

03:06.042 --> 03:07.250
Benjamin,

03:08.458 --> 03:11.249
I'm offering you a chance
to get your mind back.

03:11.250 --> 03:13.250
Your self...

03:14.042 --> 03:15.500
This is no way to live.

03:26.542 --> 03:30.000
You are the very best
at this type of thing.

03:30.667 --> 03:31.958
That's why I came.

03:32.875 --> 03:35.583
Your history with my husband
isn't part of this.

03:37.250 --> 03:40.541
He's... always part of this.

03:44.958 --> 03:46.375
It's a simple offer.

03:52.375 --> 03:54.332
Dr. Patel, six-six-three.

03:54.333 --> 03:55.500
Trust me.

04:23.792 --> 04:24.917
You're free.

04:36.875 --> 04:38.707
♪ I see the lightning flash ♪

04:39.792 --> 04:41.542

06:49.375 --> 06:50.375
Karen?

06:54.750 --> 06:55.833
It's the drugs.

06:59.875 --> 07:00.917
Heather.

07:01.625 --> 07:03.957
You okay?

07:03.958 --> 07:05.999
Fine.

07:06.000 --> 07:07.332
I...

07:09.542 --> 07:10.667
Water?

07:14.042 --> 07:15.083
Fisk?

07:16.417 --> 07:17.500
You saved his life.

07:18.208 --> 07:19.250
Yeah.

07:19.958 --> 07:24.167
I heard someone scream "gun"
and I just reacted. Poindexter?

07:24.792 --> 07:26.292
He's still at large.

07:28.042 --> 07:31.208
Kirsten, Vanessa Fisk
ordered the hit on Foggy.

07:32.833 --> 07:36.249
Listen, the case Foggy was working on,
can you get me access to it from...

07:36.250 --> 07:37.999
Hey, listen,
you're on a ton of medication.

07:38.000 --> 07:39.457
I know how this sounds.

07:39.458 --> 07:41.999
I really don't think you do.
I don't think you do. Okay?

07:44.208 --> 07:45.542
I'm still shaking.

07:47.792 --> 07:50.917
All I care is that you're still alive.

08:07.167 --> 08:08.375
Vanessa...

08:09.542 --> 08:10.583
I know.

08:13.250 --> 08:14.333
I know.

08:29.583 --> 08:31.457
Foggy knew
he was gonna win his case.

08:31.458 --> 08:34.541
I talked to Josie. He'd already
opened a bottle of O'Melveny's.

08:34.542 --> 08:36.249
I remember him drinking it.

08:36.250 --> 08:37.874
- Right?
- He was saying that he was

08:37.875 --> 08:40.832
celebrating an early win,
but I think it was just bluster.

08:40.833 --> 08:42.666
No, it wasn't.
I think he was sitting on something

08:42.667 --> 08:44.082
the Fisks didn't want exposed.

08:44.083 --> 08:46.291
You do realize
they were the ones getting shot at.

08:46.292 --> 08:48.541
- I know. Hey. I know it was them.
- Yeah.

08:48.542 --> 08:50.166
I just don't know why.

08:50.167 --> 08:52.499
Do you remember anything else
from that night?

08:52.500 --> 08:55.457
Um...

08:55.458 --> 08:59.291
I remember him saying that he was
gonna be filing a motion to dismiss.

08:59.292 --> 09:00.374
I need to see it.

09:00.375 --> 09:01.916
You can't, because it wasn't filed.

09:01.917 --> 09:03.749
Then I need to get out of here
and find it.

09:03.750 --> 09:04.875
Hey, hey. Just...

09:06.083 --> 09:09.250
You moved millions
through Red Hook.

09:10.083 --> 09:11.750
Now that I'm mayor,

09:12.583 --> 09:15.000
we can move billions.

09:18.583 --> 09:23.791
- Gallo and the police.
- Luca. Hmm.

09:23.792 --> 09:26.958
- And the gangs?
- All of it architecture.

09:29.250 --> 09:32.167
I-I ran to save the city.

09:32.875 --> 09:35.458
But opportunities present themselves.

09:39.500 --> 09:41.082
Matt, just... You gotta take it easy, Matt.

09:41.083 --> 09:42.707
I'm not losing it, Heather.

09:42.708 --> 09:46.499
However much you think you know Fisk,
you don't. And it's really dangerous.

09:46.500 --> 09:48.957
I'm sorry you don't believe me,
but I'm telling you the truth.

09:53.208 --> 09:55.408
I think it's better I come back
once you've...

09:57.000 --> 09:58.208
had some rest.

10:03.958 --> 10:05.249
I'll be out in a second.

10:11.000 --> 10:12.249
They're gonna go out there

10:12.250 --> 10:14.624
and hunt down not only Poindexter,
but all vigilantes!

10:14.625 --> 10:19.207
There'll be no body cams,
no due process, no warrants!

10:19.208 --> 10:22.207
Sir, that not only goes against
the operating principles of the NYPD,

10:22.208 --> 10:24.957
it's illegal. I mean, next, you'll be
condoning the use of lethal force.

10:24.958 --> 10:29.082
"Condoning"? Absolutely not.
Encouraging, Gallo! Encouraging!

10:29.083 --> 10:33.166
I want the bridges shut down!
I want the tunnels closed!

10:33.167 --> 10:38.124
Sir, a lone gunman attacking
the mayor is a massive affront.

10:38.125 --> 10:41.957
Of course, I see that.
But to seal the city,

10:41.958 --> 10:46.791
you need a large scale, real,
and present threat to public safety.

10:46.792 --> 10:50.208
Sheila, your concerns are noted.

10:52.250 --> 10:54.583
Now you all have a job to do.

10:58.750 --> 11:00.292
Buck, one moment, please.

11:05.958 --> 11:08.583
Tell me, what's Matt Murdock's condition?

11:09.875 --> 11:12.625
Stable. Recovering at Metro-General.

11:13.292 --> 11:17.083
Murdock saving you does complicate
the optics of things, somewhat.

11:18.750 --> 11:19.750
No.

11:21.000 --> 11:22.167
Quite the opposite.

11:23.625 --> 11:28.958
Imagine if our fearless lawyer
from Hell's Kitchen...

11:30.917 --> 11:33.832
were to succumb to his wounds.

11:33.833 --> 11:36.417
Wounds he's sustained
by trying to save the mayor.

11:37.458 --> 11:38.916
In this case,

11:38.917 --> 11:42.957
a dead hero
is better than a live vigilante.

11:52.458 --> 11:56.541
Matt, I'm really, really glad
that you're gonna be okay. I am.

11:56.542 --> 11:58.416
But we're gonna have to have a serious
conversation

11:58.417 --> 12:00.000
on the other side of this, all right?

12:04.500 --> 12:06.291
Dr. Calvinson, three-zero-six.

12:06.292 --> 12:09.333
Dr. Calvinson, three-zero-six.

12:22.833 --> 12:27.375
I've been giving thought
to what you said earlier about threats

12:28.583 --> 12:29.792
and public safety.

12:31.583 --> 12:32.750
I'm so glad, sir.

12:33.500 --> 12:37.792
Sometimes our reactions are worse
than the offenses that cause them.

12:39.833 --> 12:41.000
Sheila, I've...

12:45.333 --> 12:50.583
In business, there's always
a tipping point in a negotiation.

12:51.750 --> 12:54.500
We are in that place with this city.

12:56.750 --> 12:58.500
It just needs a little push...

13:00.458 --> 13:03.458
and they'll come to us with open arms.

13:05.958 --> 13:08.750
And what would that push be?

13:12.542 --> 13:14.500
You're a very perceptive woman.

13:16.917 --> 13:22.167
I imagine that you know
who in my staff is loyal and who is not.

13:24.500 --> 13:25.750
People talk to you.

13:28.542 --> 13:32.542
Yeah, yeah, you can say that
I've got an ear to the ground here.

13:33.792 --> 13:34.792
Good.

13:36.375 --> 13:39.958
Send everyone
who's not completely on board...

13:41.417 --> 13:42.458
home.

13:49.458 --> 13:50.458
Yes, sir.

13:54.000 --> 13:57.333
On your way out, can you send in
our friend from Con Ed?

14:20.042 --> 14:23.624
Outpatient
department manager, please dial 5-7-3.

14:23.625 --> 14:25.667
Outpatient department manager.

14:33.333 --> 14:34.583
We need to talk.

14:37.917 --> 14:38.917
Okay.

14:40.292 --> 14:42.208
I mean, you see
what's happening, right?

14:43.042 --> 14:44.458
I know you do.

14:45.375 --> 14:46.999
First, he guts the force.

14:47.000 --> 14:49.916
Crime spikes,

14:49.917 --> 14:51.708
probably due to friends of his.

14:52.292 --> 14:53.624
And then...

14:53.625 --> 14:57.374
he turns a bunch of rogue cops
into his own personal militia,

14:57.375 --> 14:59.749
sends them out as a kill squad
against the vigilantes,

14:59.750 --> 15:02.707
and now he's trying to get his hands
on the power switch to the city?

15:02.708 --> 15:05.332
It sounds like
you've got ears in the walls.

15:05.333 --> 15:08.291
There are still sane people
in the building.

15:08.292 --> 15:10.542
And I am betting that you're one of them.

15:30.958 --> 15:32.416
I'm going up the ladder.

15:32.417 --> 15:34.541
The Governor, State Supreme Court.

15:34.542 --> 15:36.749
Uh, th-this is still the mayor's office.
Not the Kingpin's.

15:36.750 --> 15:38.582
And he is still subject to the law.

15:38.583 --> 15:43.167
And I'm hoping for your support.

15:51.000 --> 15:54.500
- When?
- Tomorrow. I leave for Albany first thing.

15:55.208 --> 15:57.667
Yeah, well, there's no way
I can go with you.

15:58.333 --> 16:02.124
But if you need me to put in a word,
you got it.

16:02.125 --> 16:04.582
- I appreciate that, Sheila.
- Yeah.

16:04.583 --> 16:05.957
We'll get through this.

16:05.958 --> 16:07.875
- The city always does.
- Hmm.

16:09.250 --> 16:10.916
You watch your back.

16:10.917 --> 16:13.332
Always. You too.

16:35.250 --> 16:38.292

16:39.042 --> 16:41.958

You know
you're a wall-to-wall asshole?

17:59.750 --> 18:04.457
Power goes out, you got nothing to make
a goddamn pot of coffee in this house.

18:04.458 --> 18:06.791
Well, not everyone lives
in a fallout shelter, Frank.

18:06.792 --> 18:09.791
Is that a new costume?
What do they call you now?

18:09.792 --> 18:11.207
"Nightgown man"?

18:11.208 --> 18:14.874
What about you?
Aftershave and a haircut. That all for me?

18:14.875 --> 18:16.957
Yeah. Yeah, I did it for you.

18:16.958 --> 18:18.791
I thought this wasn't your fight.

18:18.792 --> 18:21.625
Yeah, well, I got a phone call
that changed my mind.

18:22.375 --> 18:23.707
Care to be more specific?

18:23.708 --> 18:24.917
No, I do not.

18:25.750 --> 18:28.041
I made a promise
I was gonna get you out of here alive.

18:28.042 --> 18:29.792
That's exactly what I'm gonna do.

18:30.542 --> 18:33.207
Northwest side of the house,
there's a van full of shit bags.

18:33.208 --> 18:35.249
- You clocked that?
- Yep.

18:35.250 --> 18:38.166
I'll tell you right now, they come up
here, I'm not playing patty cake

18:38.167 --> 18:41.333
with these fan boys. I'm choppin' 'em up.
You understand me?

18:41.958 --> 18:43.791
I'm not sure I want
that kind of help, Frank.

18:43.792 --> 18:46.458
Well, that's the kind of help you've got.

18:50.625 --> 18:51.625
Hey, Red.

18:52.875 --> 18:53.917
Yeah.

18:54.875 --> 18:56.833
Why would you take a bullet
for that asshole?

18:58.708 --> 19:01.957
That is a good question.

19:14.458 --> 19:16.582
We'll surprise him on inspection.
Now, let's move.

19:30.708 --> 19:32.208
All right. They're on the move.

19:33.458 --> 19:35.378
You're not gonna do it
with your ass hangin' out?

20:31.917 --> 20:33.958
Shit.

20:37.958 --> 20:39.398
Frank, stop.

22:00.708 --> 22:02.708
- You good, Red?
- Yeah, yeah, yeah.

22:03.500 --> 22:04.700
Yeah, you?

22:04.875 --> 22:06.667
Yeah.

22:11.458 --> 22:13.917
Hey, we found your guy.

22:25.083 --> 22:27.416
Cole, come in.
Do you need backup?

22:27.417 --> 22:29.250
Frank Castle's here.

22:33.958 --> 22:35.500
That yours? Huh?

22:36.542 --> 22:38.957
Yeah. You recognize that?

22:38.958 --> 22:41.457
You killed Hector Ayala.

22:44.125 --> 22:45.250
He was a good man.

22:46.333 --> 22:47.958
Do what you gotta do.

22:48.875 --> 22:52.332
I stood with my own. I can die easy.

23:18.125 --> 23:20.250
Yeah.

23:27.333 --> 23:28.792
- Do it, Red.
- Yeah.

23:29.917 --> 23:33.749
- Come on, he's right there.
- You're not worth it. Not worth it.

23:41.167 --> 23:44.832
No, Frank. No, no, no.
Please don't. It's not what I want.

23:44.833 --> 23:47.166
You get in front of a bullet
for this piece of shit too?

23:47.167 --> 23:49.624
- Is that what you do now, hero?
- He's not worth it, Frank.

23:49.625 --> 23:52.124
Not worth it. How about him?

23:52.125 --> 23:54.541
He worth it? How about that? Huh?

23:54.542 --> 23:56.791
What is wrong with you?
You can't help yourself, can you?

23:56.792 --> 23:58.291
Goddamn hands off of me!

23:58.292 --> 24:00.291
You're a goddamn liability every time.

24:00.292 --> 24:02.874
- Good for you, blind boy.
- What is wrong with you? Shut up!

24:04.167 --> 24:05.457
- Grenade.
- Huh?

24:05.458 --> 24:07.374
Run. Run, run!

24:11.125 --> 24:12.916
Oh!

24:37.458 --> 24:38.938
You're an asshole, Frank.

24:40.500 --> 24:41.620
Yeah, I know.

25:03.625 --> 25:05.375
Come on, get in.

25:07.750 --> 25:09.042
Shotgun.

25:10.542 --> 25:12.292
Don't wanna hear your shit.

25:16.292 --> 25:18.332
Copy, Three-Adam,
we need a couple more units

25:18.333 --> 25:21.666
over here to help clear the area.

25:21.667 --> 25:24.333
Roger that, Charlie.
Three on point, assistance bare.

25:25.708 --> 25:27.042
Copy that. Confirmed.

25:29.667 --> 25:30.832
How's it look?

25:30.833 --> 25:33.916
Well, you've been prettier.

25:42.875 --> 25:45.583
What's going on? You called Frank, huh?

25:46.542 --> 25:49.375
Uh-huh.
I heard Poindexter escaped.

25:50.417 --> 25:52.166
Called Frank and hopped on a plane.

25:54.417 --> 25:57.167
You couldn't call me?

25:59.500 --> 26:01.417
I needed someone
to look out for you.

26:02.375 --> 26:04.375
You definitely wouldn't have liked that.

26:09.917 --> 26:11.958
You okay over there?

26:12.667 --> 26:14.375
Never been better.

26:15.917 --> 26:18.042
Come on. Let me take a look.

26:19.125 --> 26:20.707
Nah.

26:23.333 --> 26:25.125
You know somethin', Karen?

26:26.125 --> 26:28.750
Nothin' in this world
a good cup of coffee can't fix.

26:31.917 --> 26:33.167
You want a cup?

26:36.250 --> 26:37.750
Uh, no, thank you.

26:46.625 --> 26:49.083
How about you, Red?
You want some coffee?

26:50.542 --> 26:52.707
Got any oat milk?

26:55.208 --> 27:00.042
So, he went after Matt Murdock,
not Daredevil. That's bold even for Fisk.

27:01.000 --> 27:03.167
Listen to me. Karen.
Turns out it was a hit...

27:04.417 --> 27:05.957
- on Foggy.
- Holy shit.

27:05.958 --> 27:09.166
Vanessa Fisk hired Poindexter
to take him out.

27:09.167 --> 27:10.332
Why?

27:10.333 --> 27:12.874
I think there's something
in the motion he was about to file.

27:12.875 --> 27:14.957
He was moving to dismiss the case,

27:14.958 --> 27:17.041
and Vanessa made sure he never got to it.

27:17.042 --> 27:19.874
I think maybe
I missed something back then.

27:19.875 --> 27:22.292
You know, the files have been
in storage as far as I know.

27:22.917 --> 27:25.082
That's right. Will you be my eyes?

27:25.083 --> 27:26.792
- Hey, anytime.
- Let's go.

27:32.875 --> 27:34.208
You comin', Frank?

27:35.583 --> 27:36.708
Got shit to do.

27:37.500 --> 27:39.791
Realize Fisk will be coming
for you, too.

27:39.792 --> 27:40.874
That right?

27:40.875 --> 27:44.625
I'll tell you what. If he does, I'll put
a bullet in his fat head. How about that?

27:45.458 --> 27:48.707
You know something? Inspector Gadget
bullshit...

27:48.708 --> 27:49.874
it's not for me.

27:49.875 --> 27:51.625
You guys can show yourselves out.

27:56.792 --> 27:58.458
You know what, Frank?

28:00.500 --> 28:01.749
I'm not buyin' it.

28:04.292 --> 28:05.958
I don't believe you don't care.

28:12.167 --> 28:13.250
Hey, Karen.

28:17.792 --> 28:20.792
You asked me for a favor. I did it.

28:24.208 --> 28:25.375
Yes, you did.

28:27.083 --> 28:28.208
Thank you.

28:35.875 --> 28:36.958
Stay safe.

28:38.750 --> 28:41.499
What the hell's going on?
It's the middle of the night.

28:41.500 --> 28:43.457
You've all had an opportunity
to look over

28:43.458 --> 28:45.707
Mayor Fisk's "Safer Street" initiative?

28:45.708 --> 28:47.207
Yes...

28:47.208 --> 28:48.999
- and it's insane.
- Oh.

28:49.000 --> 28:50.958
This makes
"Stop and Frisk" look like daycare.

28:51.708 --> 28:54.708
Deputy Speaker, "insane."

28:55.708 --> 28:56.916
What are you doin'?

28:56.917 --> 29:00.707
Mayor Fisk is super interested
in what the Council thinks.

29:00.708 --> 29:03.707
Especially those members
who aren't in enthusiastic support

29:03.708 --> 29:05.666
of his response to the city's crisis.

29:05.667 --> 29:07.207
That sounds like an enemies list.

29:07.208 --> 29:09.041
No, just outreach.

29:09.042 --> 29:12.707
Mayor Fisk cares deeply about
the City Council. Like you, Miss Speaker.

29:12.708 --> 29:16.249
He was so, so impressed with, um...

29:16.250 --> 29:17.916
What was it again?

29:17.917 --> 29:20.916
£540,000 stashed
in a Swiss Bank account.

29:20.917 --> 29:23.916
Right. Real estate investments
in Kips Bay, right?

29:23.917 --> 29:25.792
That, now, that's smart money.

29:26.375 --> 29:28.708
We should, you know, sit down
and share tips some time.

29:29.583 --> 29:32.416
Matter of fact,
Mayor Fisk is very interested

29:32.417 --> 29:34.375
in all the Council's accomplishments.

29:34.958 --> 29:36.082
We'd like to set meetings

29:36.083 --> 29:38.792
with each and every one of you
when the crisis has passed.

29:39.667 --> 29:41.833
Our office will reach out
to each of you shortly.

29:43.083 --> 29:44.125
Thank you, Buck.

29:47.083 --> 29:49.874
The mayor will be addressin' the city
in a couple of hours.

29:49.875 --> 29:52.458
He hopes that Safer Streets
has your full support.

29:53.333 --> 29:55.082
If not, let us know.

29:57.167 --> 29:58.583
We'll make arrangements.

30:07.667 --> 30:09.541
How are you holding up out here?

30:09.542 --> 30:13.832
Yeah, so it's a blackout,
obviously, and there's...

30:13.833 --> 30:15.707
This one is that we have people

30:15.708 --> 30:17.374
actually boarding up
their windows and doors

30:17.375 --> 30:20.416
instead of metaphorically,
and then you have people who are looting,

30:20.417 --> 30:25.250
and then you have people like me who are
just kind of watching everything happen.

30:25.792 --> 30:27.457
Like, what else am I gonna do?

30:32.500 --> 30:36.041
Freeze! Show me your hands!

30:36.042 --> 30:38.041
Hey.

30:44.125 --> 30:45.958
Jesus, Burt, he's just a kid.

30:46.958 --> 30:49.417
No. It's not a kid.

30:52.458 --> 30:54.125
It's a masked vigilante.

30:57.542 --> 30:59.957
I can't believe I didn't check
what he didn't fill out.

30:59.958 --> 31:01.624
Matt, don't beat
yourself up, okay?

31:01.625 --> 31:02.792
We were all hurting.

31:06.167 --> 31:07.500
So...

31:08.958 --> 31:10.292
you talk to Frank a lot?

31:13.917 --> 31:14.917
What?

31:15.708 --> 31:17.208
You sound like you're jealous.

31:19.333 --> 31:21.875
You know, back at his place,
I heard your heartbeats.

31:22.625 --> 31:24.417
God, that is really not fair.

31:28.500 --> 31:29.542
You heard his too?

31:30.708 --> 31:31.708
Oh, yeah.

31:33.458 --> 31:35.207
It's just adrenaline, I'm sure.

31:38.417 --> 31:40.083
You hear mine when I saw you?

31:43.333 --> 31:44.542
Yeah.

31:45.542 --> 31:46.542
Yeah?

31:49.583 --> 31:50.917
Adrenaline, I'm sure.

31:58.750 --> 31:59.750
Oh, wow.

32:02.917 --> 32:04.042
I packed this one.

32:05.792 --> 32:09.832
Oh, man. "Avocados at Law."

32:09.833 --> 32:11.541
You know, I never got that joke.

32:11.542 --> 32:13.124
- Abogados.
- Abogados!

32:13.125 --> 32:14.666
Spanish for "lawyers."

32:14.667 --> 32:16.124
- Right?
- Of course.

32:16.125 --> 32:18.791
Foggy was really drunk one night and...

32:18.792 --> 32:19.874
I don't know, it was stupid,

32:19.875 --> 32:22.833
it somehow became "Avocados at Law."

32:24.292 --> 32:26.457
Hmm.

32:37.417 --> 32:38.583
I'm glad you're back.

32:51.000 --> 32:52.666
Hey, this is it.

32:52.667 --> 32:54.627
A year and a half ago.

32:57.458 --> 32:59.999
Yes! Okay, here's the motion Foggy filed.

33:00.000 --> 33:01.582
- Right.
- Good work, Karen Page.

33:01.583 --> 33:02.667
Well...

33:04.625 --> 33:08.374
Foggy was gonna argue that... Whoa.

33:08.375 --> 33:10.582
"Due to the unique nature
of the Red Hook Port location,

33:10.583 --> 33:14.332
"no crime was committed in New York state
or even the United States of America.

33:14.333 --> 33:16.666
"Therefore, the court has no jurisdiction
to prosecute."

33:16.667 --> 33:18.958
- What?
- Wait, there's a photocopy.

33:19.833 --> 33:20.874
Aah.

33:20.875 --> 33:24.125
"Red Hook Charter, 1855."

33:25.125 --> 33:27.042
Holy crap, it's a free port.

33:28.500 --> 33:32.416
Exempt from the jurisdiction of the city,
and the country, for that matter.

33:32.417 --> 33:34.375
What would that have to do with the Fisks?

33:35.083 --> 33:39.249
Well, Vanessa has used the port
to store art for years now.

33:39.250 --> 33:42.124
I mean, if it's a free port, she's doing
it without customs, without taxation,

33:42.125 --> 33:43.499
without fear of seizures.

33:43.500 --> 33:45.457
- She could launder money legally.
- Right.

33:45.458 --> 33:48.624
And now, our mayor is building
a new complex there.

33:48.625 --> 33:50.374
This charter would make it untouchable.

33:50.375 --> 33:53.166
Gambling, smuggling,
you name it, all of it legal.

33:53.167 --> 33:57.250
God, Foggy had no idea what he stumbled
into. He thought it was a truck robbery.

33:58.458 --> 34:02.292
No, this is about the Fisks
building their own city state.

34:03.375 --> 34:05.082
Let's go see what they're hiding.

34:15.208 --> 34:17.249
What's the status report?

34:17.250 --> 34:19.166
No eyes on Murdock
and the blonde.

34:19.167 --> 34:20.832
Daredevil and Punisher got away.

34:20.833 --> 34:25.207
Jesus. Fall back to Red Hook.
Let's go huntin'.

34:26.792 --> 34:29.625
Copy that. Falling back
to rendezvous one, Red Hook.

35:07.625 --> 35:09.874
- What if he's actually here?
- Oh, shit!

35:09.875 --> 35:11.555
- It's Punisher!
- It's Castle.

35:19.917 --> 35:21.916
- Non-lethals only.
- Don't shoot!

35:21.917 --> 35:23.499
Frank, stay calm.

35:23.500 --> 35:25.124
We just wanna talk.

35:44.667 --> 35:46.374
No, no! No, no, no!

36:03.417 --> 36:04.792
Get him!

36:05.333 --> 36:07.166
Get him!

36:07.167 --> 36:08.499
Get him up!

36:11.625 --> 36:13.167
Get him!

36:20.833 --> 36:24.249
I'm going up the ladder.
Governor, State Supreme Court.

36:24.250 --> 36:27.332
Look, this is still the mayor's office.
It's not the Kingpin's.

36:27.333 --> 36:29.542
And he is still subject to the law.

36:30.458 --> 36:34.542
And I'm hoping for your support.

36:36.417 --> 36:37.541
When?

36:37.542 --> 36:40.417
Tomorrow. I'm leavin' for Albany
first thing.

36:42.000 --> 36:44.417
Well, there's no way
I can go with you.

36:45.958 --> 36:48.916
But if you need me to put in a word,

36:48.917 --> 36:50.083
you got it.

36:51.042 --> 36:52.417
I appreciate that, Sheila.

37:00.458 --> 37:03.166
Just take me home, Mario.

37:04.917 --> 37:06.582
Mario got sick.

37:09.625 --> 37:10.833
Wait, Luke?

37:11.667 --> 37:13.541
Haven't seen you in a long time,

37:13.542 --> 37:15.000
not since you were a rookie, huh?

37:15.875 --> 37:19.125
Yeah... long time ago.

37:20.750 --> 37:22.167
It's fresh ink, huh?

37:23.250 --> 37:24.750
You're part of the Task Force?

37:25.875 --> 37:27.375
The mayor recruited me.

37:32.000 --> 37:33.167
Just tryna survive.

37:33.833 --> 37:35.375
Yeah, I know.

38:09.458 --> 38:11.708
It's an honor to meet you, Castle.

38:12.708 --> 38:14.375
I'm a big admirer of your work.

38:15.958 --> 38:17.375
Jesus Christ.

38:18.375 --> 38:20.542
And I lost a lot of guys
'cause of you today.

38:23.208 --> 38:25.167
And I'm hopin'
that this is fuckin' worth it.

38:29.208 --> 38:31.292
Listen, Frank, everything that you do,

38:32.500 --> 38:36.958
you know, you can do that with us,
and you don't gotta run anymore.

38:38.542 --> 38:42.000
These guys fuckin' idolize you, man.
We all do.

38:44.958 --> 38:47.082
It'd be an honor to serve with you, Frank.

38:53.333 --> 38:55.332
You know,
you'll never get away with this.

38:55.333 --> 38:57.125
I'm still the goddamn Commissioner.

38:58.375 --> 39:00.416
New York is standing
with Mayor Fisk.

39:01.792 --> 39:05.333
It's made its choice.
We're just honoring it.

39:07.000 --> 39:08.582
Oh, you're outta your goddamn mind.

39:08.583 --> 39:09.917
You understand?

39:10.875 --> 39:14.208
There are easier ways to see me,
Mayor Fisk.

39:15.292 --> 39:16.417
Not me.

39:18.750 --> 39:19.999
They see you...

39:20.000 --> 39:23.166
But you were never really there
for the rank and file, were you?

39:23.167 --> 39:25.082
You know, the men and women
on the front line

39:25.083 --> 39:29.042
risking their lives
to keep New York safe...

39:30.042 --> 39:31.667
keep you safe.

39:32.458 --> 39:35.958
I wonder, can we blame the Commissioner?

39:36.458 --> 39:40.750
I mean, after all,
he's just a cog in a broken machine.

39:50.125 --> 39:52.082
- You admire me, huh?
- Yeah.

39:52.083 --> 39:54.208
Yeah. Hey...

39:55.667 --> 39:57.667
Out of your fuckin' mind, you know that?

39:59.583 --> 40:01.583
You're a bunch of clowns, you know that?

40:03.917 --> 40:05.333
You fuckin' clowns.

40:06.708 --> 40:07.958
Admire me.

40:10.000 --> 40:11.583
You think you know my pain?

40:14.083 --> 40:15.832
You think you know my loss?

40:20.000 --> 40:21.167
Yeah, I was right.

40:23.417 --> 40:27.500
You... never stopped being Kingpin.

40:29.458 --> 40:30.500
You can't.

40:33.208 --> 40:34.749
You admire me?

40:34.750 --> 40:36.292
What do you know about me?

40:37.083 --> 40:40.750
How I see the world?
You know how I see the world?

40:50.375 --> 40:53.333
It's just a circus. A bunch of clowns.

40:54.583 --> 40:56.291
I ain't gonna serve with you.

40:56.292 --> 40:59.457
I won't fuckin' piss on you
if you were on fire, you got that?

40:59.458 --> 41:00.874
I'm sorry to hear that, Frank.

41:00.875 --> 41:02.500
- Are you?
- Yeah.

41:04.333 --> 41:05.413
What's that?

41:06.250 --> 41:08.083
What about you? You sorry?

41:12.417 --> 41:13.583
Not so bad.

41:16.625 --> 41:18.042
We...

41:19.417 --> 41:23.582
We will keep this city safe.

41:30.667 --> 41:33.125
I'm still here.

41:37.542 --> 41:40.457
We will not let anyone...

41:43.458 --> 41:46.083
threaten our homes.

42:07.417 --> 42:08.958
Any questions?

42:12.917 --> 42:15.624
Good. Good.

42:31.625 --> 42:35.291
Shit.
It's crawling with Task Force.

42:41.000 --> 42:43.707
Hey, 40! Spread out! Let's go!

42:45.250 --> 42:47.332
All right, I'm goin' in, stay here,
stay out of sight.

42:47.333 --> 42:51.332
No! Look, it'll be Josie's all over again.

42:51.333 --> 42:53.333
You go in there, you will die...

42:54.375 --> 42:56.125
or you will kill.

42:56.750 --> 42:58.125
Now you're hurt.

42:58.875 --> 43:02.749
You will not survive.
Is that what you want?

43:07.458 --> 43:08.792
Look, Fisk has the courts...

43:09.375 --> 43:11.457
He's got the cops, he's got an army.

43:11.458 --> 43:15.207
Now, you can go down there, and you can
fight him, and you will probably die,

43:15.208 --> 43:18.832
but you can't beat him. Not like that.
You have to be smart.

43:21.708 --> 43:23.082
I'm right there with you, okay?

43:23.083 --> 43:25.707
I feel lost, I feel angry,
I feel fucking helpless.

43:25.708 --> 43:27.292
The whole city is there.

43:32.917 --> 43:34.583
Do you remember I once asked you

43:35.792 --> 43:38.458
what it was like...
living in the darkness?

43:39.792 --> 43:40.992
Do you remember what you said?

43:43.625 --> 43:45.125
It's not dark.

43:47.083 --> 43:48.792
It's like a thousand suns.

43:53.792 --> 43:56.208
Yep.

44:04.792 --> 44:06.000
Yeah, you're right.

44:08.167 --> 44:09.625
But we can beat him.

44:16.125 --> 44:18.125
I'm gonna take this city back, Karen.

44:20.292 --> 44:22.500
Where do we start?

44:23.417 --> 44:24.708
We need an army.

44:48.625 --> 44:49.958
Thank you, Buck.

44:51.917 --> 44:53.083
Are you all right, sir?

44:53.708 --> 44:55.708
Yeah, I'm fine. You?

44:58.583 --> 45:03.000
Dr. Glenn... You know
I'm going to change this city.

45:03.833 --> 45:08.458
I'm gonna turn it into a place that
we're proud to live in, but I need help.

45:09.833 --> 45:11.166
I would like for you to be

45:11.167 --> 45:14.500
my administration's
Commissioner of Mental Health.

45:23.000 --> 45:25.666
It would be my honor, Mayor Fisk.

45:38.292 --> 45:40.249
- Ten seconds.
- Mic is hot!

45:42.875 --> 45:44.083
Sir?

45:47.875 --> 45:51.042
- Sir?
- Come on! We're live.

45:57.167 --> 45:58.167
Good morning.

46:00.792 --> 46:03.792
We survived... together.

46:05.042 --> 46:09.625
As you may know, there was an attempt
on my life by a vigilante last night,

46:10.417 --> 46:14.792
and in the act of sabotage,
our city's power grid was disrupted.

46:15.583 --> 46:20.000
While facing rampant lawlessness,
Commissioner Gallo...

46:22.208 --> 46:23.875
he chose to resign.

46:27.208 --> 46:29.833
To turn his back
on the people of New York.

46:30.625 --> 46:32.417
The thin blue line has broken.

46:34.292 --> 46:38.000
I will not allow you
to live in fear, though.

46:38.708 --> 46:42.375
I am enacting my Safer Streets initiative.

46:43.250 --> 46:48.499
Effective immediately,
all vigilante activity is illegal,

46:48.500 --> 46:52.083
and it will be dealt with accordingly.

46:52.958 --> 46:55.374
Curfew is at 8:00 p.m.

46:58.792 --> 47:00.458
And in the immediate future,

47:02.792 --> 47:06.250
New York City is under martial law. Now...

47:07.833 --> 47:11.374
with the rule of law restored,

47:11.375 --> 47:16.041
we can go back
to our pursuit of life and liberty,

47:16.042 --> 47:19.792
happiness together
in the finest city in the world.

47:24.750 --> 47:27.957
Never forget, I love New York.

47:42.750 --> 47:44.208
You know, when I was a kid,

47:45.167 --> 47:46.500
after the accident,

47:48.042 --> 47:50.083
I thought God had taken my sight.

47:52.708 --> 47:54.000
When I grew up...

47:54.625 --> 47:57.542
I came to believe
that in exchange,

47:58.625 --> 48:01.083
He'd given me a special destiny...

48:05.500 --> 48:08.125
Like a mask and a purpose
could save my life.

48:12.667 --> 48:13.667
Didn't it?

48:15.000 --> 48:16.042
No.

48:16.708 --> 48:18.167
It wasn't the mask.

48:20.625 --> 48:23.292
It wasn't me needing
to believe in it that saved me.

48:26.833 --> 48:29.667
My mistake was thinking
I was immune to the darkness.

48:32.958 --> 48:34.625
And I let it creep inside me.

48:37.083 --> 48:38.542
I let the dark power me.

48:39.500 --> 48:41.792
I threw Poindexter off that rooftop.

48:43.542 --> 48:46.583
Karen, I wanted to kill him.

48:49.917 --> 48:51.083
The truth is,

48:53.333 --> 48:54.708
ever since Foggy died...

48:58.250 --> 49:00.333
I didn't know who I was anymore.

49:03.792 --> 49:06.917
Foggy believed in you.

49:07.792 --> 49:10.458
Whatever you wanna call yourself.
Whatever's...

49:11.250 --> 49:13.625
Behind the mask, behind your eyes...

49:16.417 --> 49:19.417
that's wrath, and that's mercy.

49:20.875 --> 49:24.583
That's the dark and the light.
He knew all of it. All of it.

49:25.667 --> 49:26.750
He knew you.

49:28.875 --> 49:29.999

53:57.208 --> 53:58.333
What do they call you?

53:59.208 --> 54:00.792
- Anthony.
- Anthony.

You got a last name?

54:04.167 --> 54:06.999
- Anthony Petruccio.
- There you go. Anthony Petruccio.

54:07.000 --> 54:10.583
It's a good name. It's strong.

54:11.667 --> 54:14.166
Where...

54:14.167 --> 54:17.166
Where you from, Anthony Petruccio?

54:17.167 --> 54:19.582
Jersey.

54:19.583 --> 54:22.916
Ah... Jersey.

54:22.917 --> 54:25.750
You know, I, uh, I thought so.

54:26.750 --> 54:28.582
I had a feeling, you know?

54:28.583 --> 54:31.708
- You too, yeah?
- That's right. That's right.

54:32.500 --> 54:33.667
You know, uh...

54:34.833 --> 54:37.791
You know a little about me, Anthony?

54:37.792 --> 54:40.541
- A little bit, yeah.
- A little bit, right.

54:40.542 --> 54:44.042
Oh, boy. Uh... You know,
I appreciate you...

54:45.250 --> 54:47.249
You gave me a minute like this.

54:47.250 --> 54:48.583
It's a...

54:49.333 --> 54:51.625
It's an... It's an honor to meet you.

54:57.083 --> 54:58.249
Thank you, Anthony.
