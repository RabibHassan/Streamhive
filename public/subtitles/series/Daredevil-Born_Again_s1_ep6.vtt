00:17.333 --> 00:19.666
<i>If you've seen
new street art, you're not alone.</i>

00:19.667 --> 00:22.666
<i>The provocative murals have been
popping up all around the city.</i>

00:22.667 --> 00:25.124
<i>Sometimes,
peace needs to be broken.</i>

00:25.125 --> 00:26.458
I wanna see my <i>t√≠o.</i>

00:26.958 --> 00:28.707
<i>Chaos must reign...</i>

00:28.708 --> 00:30.750
<i>Hands in the fucking air!</i>

00:31.375 --> 00:34.125
<i>...just for a moment,
to build a stronger order.</i>

00:35.542 --> 00:38.582
<i>This port is a black eye
on the face of this city.</i>

00:38.583 --> 00:40.166
I think we can do better.

00:40.167 --> 00:41.999
<i>I sent Buck to Luca</i>

00:42.000 --> 00:44.832
<i>to tell him to pay Viktor
1.8 restitution</i>

00:44.833 --> 00:46.207
<i>- for the hijacking.</i>

00:46.208 --> 00:48.457
I thought we might spend
some time on something we need

00:48.458 --> 00:50.082
- to get out into the open.
- Adam.

00:50.083 --> 00:52.374
Wilson, did you confront this man?

00:52.375 --> 00:53.457
<i>Yes.</i>

00:53.458 --> 00:55.249
I did tell him how I felt about you.

00:55.250 --> 00:57.166
<i>That I couldn't fathom</i>

00:57.167 --> 01:00.666
<i>a life of meaning without her.</i>

01:00.667 --> 01:03.666
<i>Forgiveness isn't just
the highest act of love,</i>

01:03.667 --> 01:05.499
<i>it is the only way forward.</i>

01:05.500 --> 01:06.957
Please!

01:06.958 --> 01:08.124
<i>And where is Adam now?</i>

01:08.125 --> 01:09.667
Let me out!

01:16.250 --> 01:18.666
As graffiti artists, we get this bad rep

01:18.667 --> 01:21.124
<i>that we're hurting the city,</i>

01:21.125 --> 01:22.499
but there's dangerous people out there

01:22.500 --> 01:24.957
that are actually hurting
the civilians of New York City,

01:24.958 --> 01:28.457
and people like the vigilantes
are helping them.

01:28.458 --> 01:30.124
<i>Is there law and order in New York?</i>

01:30.125 --> 01:32.125
My friend sent me this video...

01:32.542 --> 01:34.083
Yeah, yeah, yeah, check this out.

01:35.125 --> 01:36.457
Bro, look how crazy that is.

01:36.458 --> 01:39.041
Like, where do you learn that?
Kinda looks like a swordsman.

01:39.042 --> 01:41.457
Swordsman, if you're watching this,
keep doing the good work,

01:41.458 --> 01:42.625
because our cops here...

01:43.917 --> 01:45.083
they don't really do much, so...

02:42.583 --> 02:45.917
"Thou did establish Saint Ives as a judge
in the midst of his brethren,

02:48.708 --> 02:50.875
"making him a friend
and advocate of the poor.

02:54.208 --> 02:58.250
"Do thou make us, by his intercession,
steadfast in the pursuit of justice,

02:59.500 --> 03:02.583
"confident in that merciful goodness."

03:10.583 --> 03:11.833
"Through Christ our Lord..."

03:12.500 --> 03:14.041
...get you help.
You just have to stay awake.

03:14.042 --> 03:15.124
No, no, no.

03:17.792 --> 03:20.750
<i>"Who lives and reigns with you
in the unity of the Holy Spirit."</i>

03:53.917 --> 03:56.208
<i>No, Foggy! No!</i>

04:00.083 --> 04:01.083
"Amen."

04:06.917 --> 04:07.916
What are you doing?

04:07.917 --> 04:10.708
Ah, you know,
just checkin' in.

04:11.750 --> 04:13.208
You pray? Still?

04:13.708 --> 04:16.124
Yeah. I've stopped a few times
over the years, but...

04:16.125 --> 04:17.833
always end up coming back to it.

04:18.625 --> 04:21.082
So, you'll volunteer
at The Bowery Mission until 4:00.

04:21.083 --> 04:22.332
Then back to Gracie Mansion,

04:22.333 --> 04:25.166
and then the Children's Art Fund
benefit's at 7:00.

04:25.167 --> 04:26.249
That sounds nice.

04:26.250 --> 04:29.582
You go then.
I'm tired of these black tie events.

04:29.583 --> 04:31.207
I very much doubt
that's an option.

04:31.208 --> 04:34.750
Just so you know, you have
an unscheduled visitor in your office.

04:39.333 --> 04:40.333
There he is.

04:42.083 --> 04:43.750
Mr. Mayor.

04:44.458 --> 04:45.957
What are you doing here?

04:45.958 --> 04:47.874
That any way
to greet an old friend?

04:51.458 --> 04:52.625
I've got this.

04:55.542 --> 04:57.667
- You all right?
- Yeah, sure. Why?

04:58.250 --> 05:01.666
Um... You go to a bank
and get taken hostage?

05:01.667 --> 05:03.374
Oh, right, yeah, that. Sure.

05:03.375 --> 05:05.042
- Yeah, that.
- That worked out.

05:06.542 --> 05:09.416
Matt,
you were a victim of a crime.

05:09.417 --> 05:11.374
Sure, I understand.
I'm just saying that I...

05:11.375 --> 05:13.916
I... I knew I was gonna be okay.

05:13.917 --> 05:16.041
I can't really explain it.
It was just like...

05:16.042 --> 05:17.416
- Faith.
- Something like that.

05:17.417 --> 05:18.957
Thank you, though.

05:18.958 --> 05:20.082
<i>You've got five minutes.</i>

05:20.083 --> 05:21.332
Look at all these books.

05:21.333 --> 05:22.749
You haven't read a single one of 'em,
have you?

05:22.750 --> 05:23.874
Is this about the 1.8?

05:23.875 --> 05:25.792
It's all a show. The whole thing, right?

05:26.583 --> 05:27.999
Might as well be
Halloween in here.

05:28.000 --> 05:29.207
Four minutes and thirty seconds.

05:29.208 --> 05:30.667
Come on.
Is that how we're gonna do this?

05:31.917 --> 05:32.957
No foreplay?

05:32.958 --> 05:35.166
- Ugh, I'm late.
- Early patient this morning?

05:35.167 --> 05:36.541
I'm meeting with my editor. Remember?

05:36.542 --> 05:38.791
Oh, that's right.
The, uh, congratulatory breakfast.

05:38.792 --> 05:41.624
She's already putting the screws in me
about my next book.

05:41.625 --> 05:42.708
Wow, that's quick.

05:43.375 --> 05:44.666
- Mmm.
- Well...

05:44.667 --> 05:46.166
if you need help spit-balling ideas,

05:46.167 --> 05:47.292
you know where to find me.

05:48.542 --> 05:50.041
Interesting you should ask.

05:50.042 --> 05:51.582
I've told you the premise, right?

05:51.583 --> 05:52.917
Uh, maybe?

05:53.708 --> 05:54.833
Vigilantes.

05:55.750 --> 05:57.667
Why we revere the mask.

05:58.833 --> 06:00.499
I get it, cool. Yeah, interesting.

06:00.500 --> 06:01.749
Yeah. I think so.

06:01.750 --> 06:04.125
You need to give Viktor the 1.8.

06:05.125 --> 06:07.083
And I'll give you
until the end of the week.

06:10.917 --> 06:12.542
Respectfully, Mr. Mayor,

06:13.542 --> 06:16.542
you can shove that 1.8 up your ass.

06:28.792 --> 06:30.125
Make it 2.8.

06:31.125 --> 06:33.166
1.8 to Viktor,

06:33.167 --> 06:34.832
and the balance to me, of course.

06:34.833 --> 06:37.374
I-- I-- I think
it's a fascinating question.

06:37.375 --> 06:38.499
What about a mask?

06:38.500 --> 06:40.749
Does it hide us
and give us permission to do things

06:40.750 --> 06:43.874
that are legally and socially taboo,
like violence?

06:43.875 --> 06:46.957
I mean, does a mask allow us
to be our true selves,

06:46.958 --> 06:51.500
<i>or does it strip away our identity
and allow us to act like animals?</i>

06:52.083 --> 06:53.457
Hmm, yeah.

06:53.458 --> 06:55.666
Uh, I don't know. Maybe... maybe both.

06:55.667 --> 06:56.750
Maybe, right?

06:57.583 --> 07:00.542
You have experience with those people,
don't you?

07:01.875 --> 07:03.207
With animals?

07:03.208 --> 07:04.500
Vigilantes.

07:06.333 --> 07:08.457
- You've represented a few, right?
- Ooh.

07:08.458 --> 07:10.417
What, are you researching me now?

07:11.417 --> 07:13.042
You're out of the game, old man.

07:15.167 --> 07:16.333
Stay out of it.

07:17.625 --> 07:19.374
<i>Well, I've been thinking,</i>

07:19.375 --> 07:22.291
maybe you would consider
setting me up with someone like,

07:22.292 --> 07:24.542
I don't know, Frank Castle?

07:27.792 --> 07:30.832
The Punisher? You wanna...
You wanna interview The Punisher?

07:30.833 --> 07:33.000
- Bad idea?

07:33.708 --> 07:36.917
No, it's like--
That's a solid, solid idea.

07:39.500 --> 07:42.500
You've got 'till the end of the week.
Your time's up.

07:47.250 --> 07:49.791
See ya, Fisk. Give your wife my regards.

07:49.792 --> 07:51.624
Please show him out.

07:51.625 --> 07:54.124
Okay.
Um, how about Daredevil?

07:54.125 --> 07:56.458
- You've worked with him, right?

07:57.458 --> 07:59.667
Oh, shit, that's my Uber.
All right.

08:00.542 --> 08:03.125
Don't be weird.
I'm not gonna stalk your clients,

08:03.708 --> 08:05.582
- but maybe we can talk about it after?
- Sure.

08:05.583 --> 08:07.250
- Hmm?
- Of course.

10:10.208 --> 10:12.542
Mr. Mayor, it's urgent. Come.

10:13.458 --> 10:16.082
This is John Santini from Sanitation.

10:16.083 --> 10:19.457
Uh, call me Johnny. Hey, it's a pleasure
to meet you, Mr. Mayor.

10:19.458 --> 10:21.542
I work at the Sanitation. 35 years.

10:22.125 --> 10:24.082
Happy to have you, Johnny.

10:24.083 --> 10:25.791
Just want to let you know,
I voted for you.

10:25.792 --> 10:28.291
I can't tell you what a pleasure it is
to actually be here.

10:28.292 --> 10:30.791
Mr. Santini, if you would tell the Mayor
why you're here today.

10:30.792 --> 10:32.624
Oh... Right, right. The--The mural.

10:32.625 --> 10:34.916
I got bad news and worse news, Mr. Mayor.

10:34.917 --> 10:36.332
I thought that we took care of this.

10:37.417 --> 10:39.541
Nah, turns out,
it's gonna be a lot tougher

10:39.542 --> 10:40.916
to get that down than we thought.

10:40.917 --> 10:41.999
Why is that?

10:42.000 --> 10:43.832
Well, look,
I made a real good run at that wall.

10:43.833 --> 10:45.499
I got the biggest power washer,

10:45.500 --> 10:47.666
'cause I didn't wanna ruin the facade.
Didn't do squat.

10:47.667 --> 10:49.082
So, I made a switch.

10:49.083 --> 10:52.999
I switched to a 50-50 sandglass,
like a concentration.

10:53.000 --> 10:55.457
- It was the only way to go.
- You should get to the point.

10:55.458 --> 10:58.666
Oh, no, you don't understand.
See, the mural, it's made with this epoxy,

10:58.667 --> 11:00.541
so I had to do a chemical analysis.

11:00.542 --> 11:02.582
- Then I had to get this special solvent...
- Johnny.

11:02.583 --> 11:05.082
- ...from my guy in Philly--
- Just tell him what you told me.

11:05.083 --> 11:06.332
The worst news.

11:06.333 --> 11:07.791
Right. It's blood.

11:07.792 --> 11:09.582
The mural. It's made outta human blood.

11:15.167 --> 11:16.542
Get Gallo in here. Now.

11:17.750 --> 11:18.749
- Your strategy?

11:18.750 --> 11:20.707
Well, essentially, poison counsel.

11:20.708 --> 11:22.791
- Really?
- Yeah. You heard it here first.

11:22.792 --> 11:25.874
You know, Madison hired Cready,
Glaughlin, and McKagan

11:25.875 --> 11:28.666
to guide him through
a complicated yet sophisticated accounting

11:28.667 --> 11:31.083
of his new
and uncharted business model,

11:32.000 --> 11:34.624
and while they may be the city's
preeminent tax law firm,

11:34.625 --> 11:35.917
they were in over their heads.

11:37.292 --> 11:40.707
Wow, so you're literally
pointing the finger at his attorneys.

11:40.708 --> 11:43.666
Have you met the fine gentlemen
at Cready, Glaughlin, and McKagan?

11:43.667 --> 11:46.291
Oh, I have. And I approve.

11:46.292 --> 11:48.416
- What is she doing here?

11:48.417 --> 11:49.749
Who?

11:49.750 --> 11:51.417
The Ayala girl.

11:52.167 --> 11:54.457
Hey, it's good to see you.

11:54.458 --> 11:56.207
- Is everything all right?
- Yeah.

11:56.208 --> 11:57.916
I was hoping to talk to Mr. Murdock.

11:57.917 --> 12:00.041
Of course. Yeah, come in, come in.

12:00.042 --> 12:01.166
Uh... do you mind?

12:01.167 --> 12:03.208
Uh... Okay.

12:04.542 --> 12:06.292
- I'll just be in my office.
- Cool. We'll pick this up.

12:07.333 --> 12:08.333
Thanks.

12:13.417 --> 12:14.708
- Hi.
- Hi.

12:15.292 --> 12:18.082
So, 11:17 a.m., what is that,

12:18.083 --> 12:19.624
third period? Fourth?

12:19.625 --> 12:21.291
History? Biology?

12:21.292 --> 12:23.041
- English, actually.
- Oh.

12:23.042 --> 12:24.624
I'm getting a 99.

12:24.625 --> 12:26.249
One-oh-four if you factor in the curve.

12:29.708 --> 12:31.125
He was onto something, Matt.

12:31.750 --> 12:33.333
He was investigating something.

12:34.500 --> 12:35.917
<i>Someone's gotta
protect the streets.</i>

12:36.833 --> 12:38.624
People are going missing.
No one seems to care.

12:42.375 --> 12:43.583
I don't know for sure,

12:44.125 --> 12:47.291
but I think it had something to do
with all those people going missing.

12:47.292 --> 12:49.707
All those kidnappings.
He started tracking them.

12:49.708 --> 12:51.999
Angela, I know you're upset
and you have every right to be.

12:52.000 --> 12:53.207
But this isn't safe, I--

12:53.208 --> 12:55.999
Don't tell me how to be, Mr. Murdock.

12:56.000 --> 12:57.916
Mmm-mmm. Not now.

12:57.917 --> 13:00.707
Don't pull that
therapy talk that I'm processing,

13:00.708 --> 13:03.792
or trying to control, or whatever.

13:04.417 --> 13:08.083
Or that I should be in school because
that's what Hector would have wanted.

13:09.417 --> 13:11.792
This is what he would have wanted.

13:12.708 --> 13:14.749
Someone finishing his work.

13:14.750 --> 13:16.833
Someone actually doing something for once.

13:19.917 --> 13:22.582
Therapy talk? Was I doing that?

13:22.583 --> 13:24.874
Straight up.
And I hate that shit.

13:24.875 --> 13:27.333
Yeah, sure. Kinda hate it, too.

13:27.958 --> 13:31.042
All those kidnappings
were all close to the old Q line.

13:31.708 --> 13:34.457
The one they shut down. Track 61.

13:37.458 --> 13:39.624
Look, Angela,
I'm just a lawyer, all right?

13:39.625 --> 13:42.499
I tried to help your uncle in court,
but something like this,

13:42.500 --> 13:43.582
that's for the police.

13:43.583 --> 13:45.083
The police killed my uncle.

13:46.000 --> 13:47.207
I'm not going to them.

13:47.208 --> 13:49.832
All right, fair enough, fair enough,
but what do you want me to do about it?

13:52.000 --> 13:53.624
Um...

13:53.625 --> 13:57.041
How about literally anything, Mr. Murdock?

13:57.042 --> 13:58.707
Attorney at law.

13:58.708 --> 14:01.750
Big fancy office,
here to help the little guy, right?

14:02.792 --> 14:04.083
Only on your terms.

14:04.875 --> 14:08.292
'Cause when the little guy
puts something for real in your hands,

14:08.917 --> 14:09.958
you're all, "Nah."

14:13.375 --> 14:14.375
That's fine.

14:14.875 --> 14:16.417
That's cool.

14:17.292 --> 14:18.666
My bad for thinking you cared.

14:18.667 --> 14:20.041
It's not that simple, Angela.

14:20.042 --> 14:22.125
- It's not how this works.

14:23.167 --> 14:24.167
You know what?

14:25.375 --> 14:29.208
My uncle, two days before he got shot,
you know what he told me?

14:30.333 --> 14:31.374
He told me,

14:31.375 --> 14:35.083
"Don't rely on anyone
to do what you can do for yourself."

14:36.458 --> 14:39.125
Damn, he was right.

14:56.250 --> 14:58.124
<i>He mixes blood into the paint</i>

14:58.125 --> 15:00.749
and then applies the epoxy on top.

15:00.750 --> 15:03.041
It makes the murals
essentially impervious.

15:03.042 --> 15:04.791
How many murals in total?

15:04.792 --> 15:08.207
Twelve confirmed, with 18 known IDs,

15:08.208 --> 15:12.457
but we've gathered at least
five unique DNA profiles for each mural.

15:12.458 --> 15:17.166
And at five DNA profiles per mural,
we estimate at least 60 victims.

15:17.167 --> 15:19.291
It's difficult to project just yet.

15:19.292 --> 15:21.249
Testing is underway on what we now suspect

15:21.250 --> 15:24.624
may be some...
earlier pieces in his evolution

15:24.625 --> 15:26.416
and more victims.

15:26.417 --> 15:27.707
Missing reports are up...

15:27.708 --> 15:29.624
...but this can't account
for all of them.

15:29.625 --> 15:32.374
Sir, we also know
that he somehow managed to avoid detection

15:32.375 --> 15:34.707
by any of the city's surveillance footage.

15:34.708 --> 15:36.207
You have to do better than that.

15:36.208 --> 15:38.542
Based on the size
and the scope of the murals...

15:45.792 --> 15:49.374
Someone else could die 'cause they didn't
know there was a serial killer on the--

15:49.375 --> 15:51.457
- Trust me. I know what I'm doing.

16:02.500 --> 16:04.625
Sound an alarm,

16:05.167 --> 16:06.999
and he could lay low for a while.

16:07.000 --> 16:08.666
He could wait us out.

16:08.667 --> 16:10.166
Then he'll come back harder

16:10.167 --> 16:12.666
and stronger. No.

16:12.667 --> 16:14.916
Not a single word leaves this room.

16:14.917 --> 16:17.124
This is no way to run a goddamn railroad.

16:17.125 --> 16:21.666
When the Sanitation Department
figures out there's a serial killer

16:21.667 --> 16:23.375
before the NYPD does,

16:26.875 --> 16:29.333
maybe it's time
to switch up the protocols.

16:46.667 --> 16:48.916
Hey, are you Muse?

16:48.917 --> 16:50.957
Is it cool if we take a picture of you?

16:50.958 --> 16:52.124
Not-- Not a selfie, though.

16:52.125 --> 16:55.207
Just like, artist, his work,
you know.

17:10.083 --> 17:12.125
Luca came to see me.

17:13.333 --> 17:15.458
It was very disrespectful, might I add.

17:16.667 --> 17:18.332
To the Mayor's office?

17:18.333 --> 17:19.750
- Hmm.
- Huh.

17:20.583 --> 17:22.041
That's bold.

17:22.042 --> 17:23.791
That's what I thought as well.

17:23.792 --> 17:26.332
And as we imagined, he...

17:26.333 --> 17:30.583
...he has no intentions
of paying his debt.

17:33.917 --> 17:39.000
So, I... added a million dollars tax
to his bill.

17:40.083 --> 17:42.874
- Viktor will like that.

17:42.875 --> 17:44.749
If Luca ever pays up.

17:44.750 --> 17:48.042
I don't need Viktor to like it.
I need him to want it.

17:48.833 --> 17:49.874
Badly.

17:49.875 --> 17:51.083
Mmm.

17:53.958 --> 17:57.167
Vanessa, you know, politics, it's...

17:57.792 --> 18:00.291
it's a different type of problem solving.

18:00.292 --> 18:04.500
Most of it is new to me,
but some things, they remain unchanged.

18:07.125 --> 18:08.625
Find what a person wants,

18:10.792 --> 18:12.125
then either withhold it

18:13.375 --> 18:14.542
or provide it...

18:16.167 --> 18:17.500
and they'll do anything.

18:18.667 --> 18:19.833
Not tonight.

18:31.625 --> 18:34.375
You're asking New York's elite for money.

18:37.917 --> 18:39.791
I hope that everything works out for you.

18:39.792 --> 18:40.875
Mr. Mayor.

18:44.792 --> 18:46.708
Michael, it's great to see you.

18:47.208 --> 18:49.207
<i>Sure, they want influence,
but they don't need it.</i>

18:51.042 --> 18:55.041
It's like selling a Basquiat
to a billionaire.

18:55.042 --> 18:58.374
It's all just... ego and vanity.

18:58.375 --> 19:01.291
That is a curious first endeavor
you've identified, Wilson.

19:01.292 --> 19:04.749
This port project,
it's not just a first endeavor.

19:04.750 --> 19:06.624
Well, tell us then. What is it again?

19:06.625 --> 19:08.999
It's a engine of industry, is what it is.

19:09.000 --> 19:11.166
It moves growth quickly.

19:11.167 --> 19:13.749
It's got a lotta horsepower,
if you understand.

19:13.750 --> 19:16.332
Most would say
I'm the determining factor in that sector.

19:16.333 --> 19:17.457
Oh...

19:17.458 --> 19:19.874
By simply being there
and asking them for money,

19:19.875 --> 19:21.999
you're giving them all they care about.

19:22.000 --> 19:24.041
He's taking me up Madison. I saw them...

19:24.042 --> 19:26.166
This was, as I'm sure you know, one of--

19:26.167 --> 19:28.541
Certain ways we operate here, Wilson.

19:28.542 --> 19:31.375
Reassurance of their supremacy.

19:32.708 --> 19:34.582
These changes you're making
with the police,

19:34.583 --> 19:37.624
this obsession you have with vigilantes,

19:37.625 --> 19:39.291
it's just not gonna work.

19:39.292 --> 19:42.291
Whether you can do it or not
isn't the issue here, Wilson.

19:42.292 --> 19:44.542
I'm surprised
you'd even raise that specter.

19:45.125 --> 19:47.333
What we're talking about here is buy-in.

19:47.458 --> 19:50.167
This project simply...

19:50.792 --> 19:52.457
doesn't align with our interests.

19:52.458 --> 19:53.708
I've been told.

19:54.208 --> 19:55.999
And it's Mr. Mayor to you.

19:56.000 --> 19:57.707
Why don't we be honest
with each other here?

19:57.708 --> 20:00.249
I didn't realize that was on the table.
I'd like nothing more.

20:00.250 --> 20:04.124
You've made a substantial amount of your
fortune around the port, haven't you?

20:04.125 --> 20:08.417
I've had many business interests...
in my career.

20:09.292 --> 20:11.791
<i>And many associates along the way.</i>

20:11.792 --> 20:13.082
<i>What are you suggesting?</i>

20:13.083 --> 20:16.791
I'm saying your port expansion project
is a self-serving con, Mr. Mayor.

20:16.792 --> 20:19.457
You're using taxpayer dollars
to further enrich yourself.

20:19.458 --> 20:21.875
And your colleagues, so to speak.

20:23.458 --> 20:27.167
You know, I've--
I always put the city before myself.

20:28.375 --> 20:30.124
<i>And if you're suggesting
anything different,</i>

20:30.125 --> 20:32.125
<i>well, that's just nonsense.</i>

20:34.917 --> 20:36.875
You may have a seat
at the table right now,

20:37.500 --> 20:39.249
for a couple of years anyway,

20:39.250 --> 20:42.458
but the people in this room
still decide who gets to eat.

20:43.750 --> 20:45.916
I suggest you don't lose sight of that.

20:50.417 --> 20:52.875
Tell your wife the flowers
were exquisite tonight, if you would.

20:57.208 --> 20:59.708
The people that actually make it happen,

21:00.375 --> 21:01.583
they don't sit around and wait.

21:02.208 --> 21:03.708
People in this room... they...

21:05.833 --> 21:07.374
They know nothing about that.

21:07.375 --> 21:10.458
Underestimate the people in this room
at your own peril.

21:11.125 --> 21:13.582
They may not use garrotes

21:13.583 --> 21:15.791
- or cement shoes.

21:15.792 --> 21:18.542
One phone call to the right person,
and well...

21:19.583 --> 21:21.291
Bye-bye, Gracie Mansion.

21:21.292 --> 21:22.874
That's a threat?

21:22.875 --> 21:24.249
No.

21:24.250 --> 21:27.417
No, no, no, it's, uh... It's a warning.

21:32.708 --> 21:34.000
- Oh.

21:36.042 --> 21:37.999
- Oh.
- Yeah.

21:38.000 --> 21:41.708
It seems my suits aren't fitting
like they were.

21:43.333 --> 21:45.833
I guess we have to get you
a new wardrobe, then.

21:51.125 --> 21:54.707
<i>...Astoria.
It is rumored dating back to the 1800s...</i>

21:54.708 --> 21:55.791
Workin' late?

21:55.792 --> 21:58.499
<i>Presently,
Track 61 is used as a storage...</i>

21:58.500 --> 21:59.916
I hope that's not for you.

21:59.917 --> 22:01.000
<i>...and a van.</i>

22:04.042 --> 22:05.042
Oh boy.

22:06.542 --> 22:07.583
What's up?

22:16.167 --> 22:17.166
Cherry, what is it?

22:17.167 --> 22:20.542
You're gonna hear about it anyway,
but I-- I'd rather you hear it from me.

22:21.375 --> 22:23.916
- Okay.
- I got a call from my guy at the precinct.

22:23.917 --> 22:27.624
Said there's a serial killer out there.
They're going through a DEFCON scenario.

22:27.625 --> 22:28.708
How many victims?

22:30.125 --> 22:31.458
Cherry?

22:32.708 --> 22:33.957
What? How-- How many?

22:33.958 --> 22:35.917
Upwards of 60, so they say.

22:37.000 --> 22:38.916
They've identified a suspect, though.

22:38.917 --> 22:40.416
- Who is it?
- Graffiti artist,

22:40.417 --> 22:42.207
paintin' walls all around town.

22:42.208 --> 22:43.958
Goes by the name "Muse."

22:47.125 --> 22:48.124
Apparently...

22:48.125 --> 22:49.249
Apparently what?

22:52.292 --> 22:54.208
He paints
with his victims' blood.

23:02.583 --> 23:03.667
Matt...

23:04.375 --> 23:06.292
you gotta be straight with me, buddy.

23:07.250 --> 23:08.999
You gotta let this one go.

23:09.000 --> 23:11.792
Just let the police do their jobs.

23:31.042 --> 23:32.874
These people are like parasites.

23:32.875 --> 23:35.416
Can't they see how important
this port project is?

23:35.417 --> 23:36.499
- Sir.
- Hi.

23:36.500 --> 23:38.041
- Vanessa, this way, this way.
- Yes.

23:38.042 --> 23:39.624
There's something you need to see.

23:39.625 --> 23:41.125
Very nice to see you.

23:41.917 --> 23:44.291
Yes, I remember Brian, of course.

23:44.292 --> 23:45.375
Vanessa.

23:46.333 --> 23:48.624
I'm sorry, but there's pressing business.

23:48.625 --> 23:50.417
Can you make my apologies for me?

23:51.208 --> 23:52.374
Yes, of course.

23:59.792 --> 24:02.500
These came straight
from the forensic team, sir.

24:15.458 --> 24:17.208
Man's obviously mocking the police.

24:23.458 --> 24:24.667
We can use this.

24:25.542 --> 24:27.749
- Marker.
- <i>Do you feel safe on the streets?</i>

24:27.750 --> 24:31.499
I ain't supposed to say nothin',
but I hear two girls have gone missing.

24:31.500 --> 24:33.499
I mean, nobody really knows
what happened to them,

24:33.500 --> 24:35.832
<i>but when you go missing
down here in the city,</i>

24:35.833 --> 24:37.624
<i>everyone knows something is up.</i>

24:37.625 --> 24:40.374
We hear that there's one girl
or a couple girls found dead,

24:40.375 --> 24:42.249
but they're drained out of their blood.

24:42.250 --> 24:45.541
We really need someone out here to,
like, protect us,

24:45.542 --> 24:48.249
'cause, baby,
I don't feel safe out here.

24:48.250 --> 24:49.582
This is ridiculous.

24:49.583 --> 24:52.666
I've got a serial killer on the loose,
you cut the force's overtime,

24:52.667 --> 24:55.457
and now I need to report to you
on the Muse case?

24:55.458 --> 24:56.624
Well, I care about this city.

24:56.625 --> 24:58.457
Then put more cops on the street!

24:58.458 --> 25:00.500
That's exactly why I asked you here.

25:01.625 --> 25:02.625
I intend to.

25:06.792 --> 25:08.000
A task force.

25:08.958 --> 25:10.083
Hand-picked by me.

25:14.667 --> 25:16.374
This is every bad apple
in the barrel.

25:16.375 --> 25:20.791
Yes, it appears your officers
have a subculture amongst them.

25:20.792 --> 25:22.999
People like to use the word "gang."

25:23.000 --> 25:25.249
I prefer "motivated individuals."

25:25.250 --> 25:28.541
And due to the extreme nature
of these crimes,

25:28.542 --> 25:32.167
this task force will have special powers
and privileges...

25:33.042 --> 25:34.916
- Like overtime.

25:34.917 --> 25:38.374
And... no body cameras.

25:38.375 --> 25:40.082
That sort of thing.

25:40.083 --> 25:43.000
Ah... And who the hell's
gonna oversee this?

25:43.625 --> 25:45.916
Like I said, I care about the city.

25:53.708 --> 25:54.957
- ...last week, right?
- Yeah.

25:54.958 --> 25:56.707
- We gotta make that pickup.
- No, we don't.

25:56.708 --> 25:58.624
- We're not gonna get that guy...
- Stop.

25:58.625 --> 26:00.457
This city is in a crisis.

26:00.458 --> 26:03.499
A serial killer is roaming our streets.

26:03.500 --> 26:05.207
He needs to be stopped!

26:09.250 --> 26:12.292
Okay, but, uh, why us?

26:13.792 --> 26:14.917
Because some of you...

26:18.042 --> 26:20.207
You're victims of bad luck.

26:20.208 --> 26:23.624
Others, you've been a little overzealous.

26:23.625 --> 26:26.833
But all of you, throughout your careers,
have shown initiative.

26:27.875 --> 26:29.374
Sergeant Cole North.

26:29.375 --> 26:30.624
Yes, sir.

26:30.625 --> 26:32.374
Born and raised in Chicago,

26:32.375 --> 26:34.166
top of your class in the Academy,

26:34.167 --> 26:37.000
made Detective in only three years.
That's quite impressive.

26:41.458 --> 26:43.042
Yet here you are in New York.

26:45.125 --> 26:46.541
You lost it all.

26:46.542 --> 26:49.999
Tell us what happened January 14th.

26:50.000 --> 26:53.792
I was responding to a call,
possible drug activity in the park.

26:54.333 --> 26:57.791
Upon my arrival,
I saw a guy hand an 11-year-old some oxy.

26:57.792 --> 26:59.416
The guy denied everything.

26:59.417 --> 27:03.166
So, I... encouraged him
to tell the truth.

27:03.167 --> 27:04.875
Captain didn't see it that way.

27:06.958 --> 27:08.792
There's a lotta shitbags
in the world, sir.

27:10.792 --> 27:12.042
Now there's a lot less of 'em.

27:12.667 --> 27:14.875
Yes, that-- that's right.

27:15.458 --> 27:17.916
- Sometimes...

27:17.917 --> 27:21.292
...when you need to get the job done,
it requires a little...

27:22.875 --> 27:25.042
well, creative thinking.

27:25.583 --> 27:28.791
I assume Gallo has told you
that we have a serial killer in our midst.

27:28.792 --> 27:30.416
I want to be clear.

27:30.417 --> 27:32.999
I've brought you here
because of your skills.

27:33.000 --> 27:35.707
Because of your ability to get results.

27:35.708 --> 27:40.332
Consider yourself founding members
of my Anti-Vigilante Task Force.

27:40.333 --> 27:41.916
Buck?

27:46.208 --> 27:48.791
This killer, Muse, he wears a mask.

27:48.792 --> 27:52.166
Well, that's because he's afraid.
I don't want you to be afraid.

27:52.167 --> 27:55.582
I want you to show your faces,
because you are New York's finest,

27:55.583 --> 27:58.042
- and this city is yours!

27:58.833 --> 28:01.957
And you're not gonna
let some masked criminals

28:01.958 --> 28:03.666
take it away from you!

28:03.667 --> 28:05.416
- Yeah!
- Isn't that right?

28:08.208 --> 28:09.208
Okay.

29:09.583 --> 29:13.708
<i>Designed to ferry VIPs

29:14.375 --> 29:18.041

to a series of abandoned rail tunnels</i>

29:18.042 --> 29:20.291
<i>dating back to the 1800s.</i>

29:20.292 --> 29:23.082
- <i>Call from Ayala Home.</i>

29:23.083 --> 29:24.542
<i>Answer or decline?</i>

29:25.125 --> 29:26.332
<i>Call from Ayala--</i>

29:26.333 --> 29:28.541
- Hello?
<i>- Matt? It's Soledad.</i>

29:28.542 --> 29:29.791
<i>I'm sorry to call you so late.</i>

29:29.792 --> 29:31.832
No, Soledad, it's fine.
What's-- What's goin' on?

29:31.833 --> 29:34.999
<i>It's Angela. She still hasn't
come home. That's not like her.</i>

29:35.000 --> 29:36.291
<i>Has she been in touch with you?</i>

29:36.292 --> 29:38.124
<i>She told me
she was going to see you, Matt.</i>

29:38.125 --> 29:40.624
<i>I'm worried. I'm so worried.
She's never done this before.</i>

29:40.625 --> 29:42.416
<i>I didn't know who else to call.
She's never--</i>

29:42.417 --> 29:44.166
It's okay. Soledad, it's okay.

29:44.167 --> 29:45.457
Just stay where you are.

30:03.417 --> 30:05.083
<i>911,
what is your emergency?</i>

30:06.708 --> 30:07.708
<i>Hello?</i>

30:09.750 --> 30:11.207
<i>Hello? 911.</i>

30:11.208 --> 30:12.291
Fuck it.

33:20.125 --> 33:22.458
I can imagine that Vanessa

33:23.958 --> 33:25.708
would like for me to let you go.

33:26.500 --> 33:27.500
Thank you.

33:29.667 --> 33:30.667
Thank you!

33:35.958 --> 33:38.333
But that's a difficult thing for me to do.

33:41.042 --> 33:42.458
You understand that, right?

33:43.708 --> 33:46.957
How we are... locked together.

33:49.375 --> 33:52.500
Our experience... shared.

33:55.042 --> 33:57.583
And... when I was younger, smaller,

34:00.333 --> 34:02.750
I went up against men three times my size.

34:04.083 --> 34:05.083
Yeah.

34:06.750 --> 34:10.208
Men who knew how to use their hands,
and they did so, often.

34:14.958 --> 34:16.208
And I learned that...

34:18.875 --> 34:20.375
a simple tool,

34:21.625 --> 34:23.833
it can be a great equalizer.

37:46.042 --> 37:47.791
Mine!

38:07.917 --> 38:11.082

- Daredevil?

39:25.417 --> 39:26.750
It's okay. I'm here.

39:27.500 --> 39:31.042
Yeah. I'm here.
