WEBVTT

00:00.950 --> 00:02.237
Thank you, New York.

00:02.242 --> 00:05.487
It's humbling to be speaking to you
as mayor of this fair city.

00:05.492 --> 00:06.945
The city is in shambles.

00:06.950 --> 00:08.518
A feeling of uneasiness...

00:08.523 --> 00:10.343
... as if at any moment,

00:10.348 --> 00:11.736
things could explode.

00:15.592 --> 00:18.120
NYPD. Do not move.

00:18.125 --> 00:20.678
Remember I told you
that I'd get things done?

00:20.683 --> 00:22.320
Well, here I am getting them done.

00:22.325 --> 00:24.278
An NYPD cop is dead.

00:24.283 --> 00:26.962
And anytime that happens,
a big machine gets turned on

00:26.967 --> 00:28.492
to try to figure out what went wrong.

00:28.497 --> 00:29.977
And to punish whoever killed the cop.

00:33.908 --> 00:36.362
Do some digging on Hector.
Something doesn't track.

00:36.367 --> 00:39.920
Mr. Ayala, yes or no. Are you the
vigilante known as the White Tiger?

00:39.925 --> 00:41.762
Objection, Your Honor!

00:41.767 --> 00:43.028
Order!

00:43.033 --> 00:45.937
These vigilantes, they are not heroes.

00:45.942 --> 00:48.645
In the matter of
the People v. Hector Ayala,

00:48.650 --> 00:51.195
the jury finds the defendant not guilty.

00:57.620 --> 01:05.120
- Synced and corrected by Firefly -
- www.addic7ed.com -

01:29.267 --> 01:31.862
- Sorry about your client, Murdock.
- Yeah, me too.

01:31.867 --> 01:33.728
So, 9 millimeter to the temple.

01:33.733 --> 01:35.983
Execution style. No room
for error. What else?

01:36.592 --> 01:38.942
The right side marginal abrasion.

01:39.425 --> 01:42.295
External bevel on the entrance
wound. Exit wound has skin tears

01:42.300 --> 01:44.175
- and raised skull fragments.
- Projectile?

01:44.675 --> 01:48.462
Not recovered. High velocity,
jacketed. Maybe even custom.

01:48.467 --> 01:51.228
Single kill shot at extreme close range
and no one found the casing?

01:51.233 --> 01:53.795
Hey. If it's not on the body,
it's not my problem.

01:59.008 --> 02:00.462
How did you get in here?

02:00.467 --> 02:03.128
I want to see my uncle, Hector Ayala.

02:03.133 --> 02:05.917
- You're not supposed to be here.
- It's okay, Angela,

02:06.383 --> 02:08.058
- he's right.
- You got him out of jail.

02:09.175 --> 02:10.758
Lotta good that did him, huh?

02:12.525 --> 02:15.853
I wanna see my tío. I... I
wanna see what they did to him.

02:15.858 --> 02:17.753
You don't, trust me.

02:17.758 --> 02:19.962
It's best you remember
Hector the way he was.

02:19.967 --> 02:21.050
Come on. Let's go.

02:25.717 --> 02:27.175
They killed him, didn't they?

02:28.383 --> 02:29.712
The police.

02:29.717 --> 02:32.217
We... We don't know. We
don't know that, Angela.

02:32.717 --> 02:35.217
Come on. You're a lawyer.

02:36.133 --> 02:39.503
You ain't dumb. He got
in the middle of something.

02:39.508 --> 02:42.087
Busted up a fight with his mask off.

02:42.092 --> 02:45.920
Asshole cops were dirty.
You got him out of jail.

02:45.925 --> 02:47.753
They put a bullet through his head.

02:49.300 --> 02:52.170
You don't gotta be good at math to
put one and one together, you know?

02:52.175 --> 02:53.175
I know.

02:54.567 --> 02:57.000
- I'm sorry.
- I hate them, Mr. Murdock.

02:57.650 --> 03:00.978
I hate this city. No one's
doing anything about it

03:00.983 --> 03:03.087
and no one's ever gonna
do anything about it,

03:03.092 --> 03:05.001
'cause he was just Hector
from the Heights

03:05.006 --> 03:07.026
and they're the fucking cops.

03:16.925 --> 03:19.845
It's not fair. It's not fair.

03:19.850 --> 03:21.212
I know, I know. It's okay.

03:21.217 --> 03:23.467
It's okay. Look, here,
listen. Listen to me.

03:24.217 --> 03:28.628
You have to believe that someone
will find his killer. Okay?

03:28.633 --> 03:31.667
We have to believe it. You understand?

03:34.508 --> 03:35.508
Come here.

06:01.550 --> 06:03.217
Oh, shit!

06:05.008 --> 06:06.128
Here you go.

06:06.133 --> 06:07.467
- Thank you.
- Yep.

06:10.800 --> 06:12.087
- Hey!
- Hey!

06:15.842 --> 06:17.008
Shots!

06:17.642 --> 06:20.208
I can't, BB. I think I gotta take off.

06:20.592 --> 06:21.927
No, come on!

06:21.932 --> 06:24.937
Dude, Fisk is riding you way too
hard. This whole in by eight...

06:24.942 --> 06:27.287
Seven, actually. So, I gotta go.

06:27.292 --> 06:29.545
Hey, see, this is exactly
what I'm talking about.

06:29.550 --> 06:31.753
Any normal job, we would
take a few more shots,

06:31.758 --> 06:33.878
hit up that spot on 23rd,
sleep on the train,

06:33.883 --> 06:36.128
take a shower, go to work
and do it all over again.

06:36.133 --> 06:39.428
What kind of normal routine
is that? Absolutely not.

06:39.433 --> 06:41.128
Dude, and working for Fisk is?

06:41.133 --> 06:43.170
What can I say? I love the guy.

06:43.175 --> 06:44.175
Oh, God!

06:45.050 --> 06:46.628
No, seriously. Like this afternoon,

06:46.633 --> 06:48.703
we're supposed to meet
with the CleanGreen Haulers.

06:48.708 --> 06:52.170
It's this new tech company with this
dope recycling idea, you know?

06:52.175 --> 06:54.587
Oh, recycling. That could be cool.

06:54.592 --> 06:57.845
It's awesome. It would actually
decrease garbage output.

06:57.850 --> 06:59.153
Okay, but isn't the problem...

06:59.158 --> 07:01.920
I know you're gonna say
union contracts, but no.

07:01.925 --> 07:05.375
We're gonna start with the ports.
Dual jurisdiction. It's genius.

07:05.800 --> 07:09.633
If we're not gonna keep drinking,
can we at least get some food?

07:10.175 --> 07:12.212
- Absolutely. Yeah. Okay.
- No. I gotta go.

07:12.217 --> 07:13.603
- Come on. We're going.
- Come on.

07:13.608 --> 07:15.358
I...

07:20.675 --> 07:21.795
I am starving.

07:21.800 --> 07:23.503
Ooh, I can go for some
corn cakes right now.

07:23.508 --> 07:25.445
- No, no.
- No, just a quick bite.

07:25.450 --> 07:27.283
I can't, stop making me feel guilty.

07:27.608 --> 07:29.420
Okay. Fine.

07:29.425 --> 07:32.083
Let's get Captain Planet here a cab.

07:40.467 --> 07:41.670
Staten Island Ferry.

07:41.675 --> 07:43.353
- Okay. Bye, grandpa.
- Got it.

07:44.842 --> 07:46.458
No, I didn't do this, man.

07:51.092 --> 07:53.212
You want butter toffee
or caramel with peanuts?

07:53.217 --> 07:54.378
Butter toffee.

07:54.383 --> 07:56.687
- Toffee for the man.
- Man, you can't eat that.

07:56.692 --> 07:59.045
Hey, Wilcox. Are these boxes evidence?

07:59.050 --> 08:01.690
Nah. Them other boxes was
evidence, I paid for this shit.

08:01.695 --> 08:03.765
Hey, seriously. Nothin' for fatty.

08:03.770 --> 08:05.933
Okay, get your ass up. Let's go.

08:06.592 --> 08:09.003
- Man, get... I got it, man. Shit.
- Come on.

08:09.008 --> 08:11.087
- Ready? Let's go.
- All right. All right. All right.

08:11.092 --> 08:12.962
All units...

08:18.050 --> 08:20.878
Incoming call from Kirsten.

08:20.883 --> 08:23.795
Incoming call from Kir...

08:26.800 --> 08:29.545
- Hey.
- Hey. Hi, how are you?

08:29.550 --> 08:31.467
I heard Hector's niece
came to the morgue.

08:32.383 --> 08:33.842
Yeah, it was pretty rough.

08:34.550 --> 08:37.958
- Did she...
- No. God, no. No kid should see that.

08:38.758 --> 08:41.328
Okay, look, this is terrible timing,

08:41.333 --> 08:43.712
- but I need you downtown today.
- Understand.

08:43.717 --> 08:44.962
Yeah.

08:44.967 --> 08:47.006
We'll, uh, post for another associate.

08:47.011 --> 08:48.526
No. The revolver is too low.

08:49.174 --> 08:50.643
Well, I'm working on that, too.

08:50.648 --> 08:52.670
Already set meetings
with a bunch of banks.

08:52.675 --> 08:54.253
Say what you want about big firms,

08:54.258 --> 08:56.178
but you never have to worry
about money problems.

08:56.183 --> 08:57.498
But you're gonna like this one.

08:57.503 --> 09:00.503
It's Leroy Bradford
from the city docket.

09:00.508 --> 09:02.347
I'm underwater on this Madison case

09:02.352 --> 09:04.378
and we owe them a freebie this month.

09:04.383 --> 09:06.337
Can you just meet him down in Detention?

09:06.342 --> 09:09.203
- You had me at freebie.
- Thank you.

09:24.850 --> 09:26.462
I thought we might spend some time

09:26.467 --> 09:28.362
on something we need
to get out into the open.

09:28.367 --> 09:32.045
Until we explore this, we can't
really make any progress.

09:32.050 --> 09:33.962
- Adam...
- I'd rather not.

09:33.967 --> 09:36.253
I understand.

09:36.258 --> 09:39.545
But I would urge you
to sit in the discomfort,

09:39.550 --> 09:43.420
and maybe just for a moment,
we can acknowledge the affair.

09:43.425 --> 09:46.133
That's stupid. A ridiculous term.

09:47.608 --> 09:50.025
Not a dinner party. It was betrayal.

09:51.883 --> 09:56.420
You were gone. I didn't know when
or if you were ever coming back.

09:56.425 --> 09:59.462
You knew. You know me,
you knew I wouldn't stay away.

09:59.467 --> 10:02.120
You left. That was a betrayal.

10:02.125 --> 10:05.008
- You know why...
- Let's let Vanessa speak for a moment.

10:05.633 --> 10:06.958
Tell me about Adam.

10:07.467 --> 10:09.187
- You're asking for details?
- No.

10:09.925 --> 10:11.500
I'm curious about you.

10:12.692 --> 10:15.025
What you were feeling. Why him?

10:18.858 --> 10:20.233
It was his hands.

10:22.233 --> 10:24.317
His hands drew...

10:25.633 --> 10:29.312
- beautiful sketches. I mean, just...
- Can we not?

10:29.317 --> 10:34.808
It was like finding a Klee
at a garage sale. It was just...

10:38.275 --> 10:41.142
He wasn't part of my husband's world.

10:41.567 --> 10:44.495
And what world is that? Politics?

10:44.500 --> 10:45.625
Business.

10:46.858 --> 10:47.858
I see.

10:50.233 --> 10:52.770
Has infidelity been a part
of your marriage before this?

10:52.775 --> 10:54.437
Absolutely not. Never.

10:54.442 --> 10:55.483
You left.

10:56.858 --> 10:59.353
Which felt like taking half of me away.

11:02.275 --> 11:04.358
Did that trigger something
for you, Vanessa?

11:06.483 --> 11:07.692
My father...

11:10.483 --> 11:12.103
he was in textiles.

11:14.067 --> 11:16.442
He would leave for weeks at a time.

11:17.942 --> 11:18.942
He drank.

11:19.567 --> 11:21.895
He, uh, gambled.

11:21.900 --> 11:24.150
His behavior ate at my mother.

11:25.525 --> 11:26.525
Crushed her.

11:27.392 --> 11:29.517
I never respected her for that.

11:32.858 --> 11:36.275
I needed to feel alive.
Not crushed down.

11:38.733 --> 11:40.108
When you left, you hurt me.

11:40.650 --> 11:42.228
You never told me.

11:42.233 --> 11:43.783
I never had a reason to.

11:44.983 --> 11:46.975
I assume you wanna
move forward from this.

11:47.942 --> 11:50.608
- Did you end the affair?
- I never had the opportunity.

11:53.650 --> 11:55.483
Why not? Did something happen?

11:57.317 --> 11:59.400
Wilson, did you confront this man?

12:00.650 --> 12:01.650
Yes.

12:03.108 --> 12:04.312
We had a dialogue.

12:06.317 --> 12:07.608
What kind of dialogue?

12:10.733 --> 12:11.900
A clarifying one.

12:12.900 --> 12:14.967
- Would you like to be more specific?
- No.

12:16.067 --> 12:18.228
Oh... So that's what we're doing here.

12:18.233 --> 12:20.395
This is just window dressing.

12:20.400 --> 12:22.728
I know you, your methods
are much more direct.

12:22.733 --> 12:25.275
No. They were, not now.
It was a conversation.

12:25.858 --> 12:28.692
That's all. There was
no expression of ill intent.

12:30.108 --> 12:31.983
I did tell him how I felt about you.

12:33.900 --> 12:35.367
About our marriage.

12:37.733 --> 12:38.942
And I told him...

12:40.275 --> 12:41.995
... that I couldn't fathom

12:43.158 --> 12:46.437
a life of meaning without her.

12:49.817 --> 12:52.067
And where is Adam now?

12:53.150 --> 12:54.367
I don't know.

12:58.692 --> 13:02.228
I wanna go back to the first question
I asked you during our intake.

13:02.233 --> 13:06.520
"Are we here to dissolve a marriage
or preserve one?"

13:06.525 --> 13:08.150
I want you to think about it.

13:09.108 --> 13:11.150
Really think about it
before I see you again.

13:12.050 --> 13:15.020
Without forgiveness, and
I say this to both of you,

13:15.025 --> 13:16.692
there can be no real healing.

13:17.483 --> 13:20.895
Forgiveness isn't just
the highest act of love,

13:20.900 --> 13:22.492
it is the only way forward.

13:25.025 --> 13:26.150
Good work today.

13:31.857 --> 13:33.082
If you two don't mind,

13:33.087 --> 13:35.687
I'd love to speak to Vanessa
alone for a moment please.

13:35.692 --> 13:36.692
Just the two of us.

13:49.150 --> 13:50.775
Is something wrong, Dr. Glenn?

13:51.608 --> 13:52.687
I'm not sure.

13:52.991 --> 13:54.990
Based on the nature
of our discussion today,

13:54.995 --> 13:57.400
I feel obligated to ask...

13:59.608 --> 14:01.367
Do you feel safe in your marriage?

14:02.692 --> 14:04.853
Oh... You think...

14:07.675 --> 14:08.800
How sweet of you.

14:12.775 --> 14:16.683
My husband is capable of many,
many things, some of them extreme.

14:17.192 --> 14:19.692
Harming me is not one of them.

14:31.275 --> 14:33.478
Mayor Fisk. He might be a nice guy,

14:33.483 --> 14:34.895
but I think he's in over his head.

14:34.900 --> 14:38.103
Vigilantes, love 'em. Should've
had that a long time ago.

14:38.108 --> 14:40.937
They're the only people that can
solve the problem in New York.

14:40.942 --> 14:43.650
I wish I could be a vigilante,
I'd be out there, too.

14:51.692 --> 14:54.358
Leroy Bradford? Is there
a Leroy Bradford?

14:59.275 --> 15:03.353
Man, look at this. I get
the freakin' blind dude.

15:06.025 --> 15:07.483
Let's go.

15:08.192 --> 15:10.233
Bring on the blind justice.

15:14.525 --> 15:17.937
Mr. Bradford, my name is Matthew
Murdock, I'm gonna be your lawyer.

15:17.942 --> 15:19.070
Lucky me.

15:19.075 --> 15:21.339
As I understand it, you've been
charged with petty larceny,

15:21.344 --> 15:22.645
a class A misdemeanor.

15:22.650 --> 15:25.562
The complaint against you alleges
you stole approximately five boxes

15:25.567 --> 15:28.067
- of Fiddle Faddle from a bodega.
- Well, I didn't do it.

15:28.567 --> 15:30.920
- Uh... Okay.
- I said, I didn't do that shit!

15:30.925 --> 15:34.103
I understand. The thing is, the bodega
where this allegedly occurred

15:34.108 --> 15:37.025
has a surveillance system,
involving many cameras.

15:37.733 --> 15:40.062
They've already turned over
to the prosecution footage

15:40.067 --> 15:42.187
which they claim shows
you stealing the items.

15:42.192 --> 15:44.728
In addition, the cashier
is willing to testify

15:44.733 --> 15:46.895
she was an eyewitness
to the whole thing,

15:46.900 --> 15:49.645
and the store security guard will
testify that when he detained you,

15:49.650 --> 15:51.337
you were in possession of multiple boxes

15:51.342 --> 15:53.052
of Fiddle Faddle caramel corn.

15:54.608 --> 15:56.270
Uh, finally, the police will corroborate

15:56.275 --> 15:57.869
that several boxes of the caramel corn

15:57.874 --> 15:59.120
were recovered outside of the store.

15:59.125 --> 16:01.687
Look, I paid for that shit last week.

16:01.692 --> 16:04.312
Unfortunately, it doesn't really
work like that, Mr. Bradford.

16:04.317 --> 16:06.478
Generally, you pay for
what you buy that day.

16:06.483 --> 16:08.133
Then they all lying on me, then.

16:10.400 --> 16:11.520
You hear me?

16:11.525 --> 16:12.650
Um...

16:13.008 --> 16:15.728
Also, I saw them cops
eatin' two boxes of that shit.

16:15.733 --> 16:17.478
Now that I'm entirely
willing to believe.

16:17.483 --> 16:19.853
Then how come they don't arrest
themselves for stealing?

16:19.858 --> 16:21.270
Maybe they should have.

16:21.275 --> 16:23.390
Uh, but the complexity of that aside,

16:23.395 --> 16:24.853
we're here 'cause they arrested you.

16:27.567 --> 16:28.833
Could it have been a Skrull?

16:30.400 --> 16:31.545
Nope.

16:31.550 --> 16:34.187
And the bigger problem
we have is your rap sheet.

16:34.192 --> 16:36.687
How come you guys always
gotta bring that up?

16:36.692 --> 16:39.145
What I did back then ain't got
nothing to do with this.

16:39.150 --> 16:41.603
That's true, but when a judge
sees a sheet like yours,

16:41.608 --> 16:44.206
20, 25 pages of offenses, drugs,

16:44.211 --> 16:46.103
trespassing, panhandling, petty larceny,

16:46.108 --> 16:47.658
not to mention the four separate cases

16:47.663 --> 16:49.187
where you failed to appear in court,

16:49.192 --> 16:51.020
and they had to issue a bench warrant.

16:51.025 --> 16:52.275
I gotta get home, man.

16:53.067 --> 16:54.895
Like I said, I ain't going to jail.

16:54.900 --> 16:58.520
If you decide to fight the case,
with the video evidence,

16:58.525 --> 17:00.478
your rap sheet, history
of bench warrants,

17:00.483 --> 17:01.990
the judge will almost
certainly set bail.

17:01.995 --> 17:03.270
Which means unless
you can pay the bail...

17:03.275 --> 17:04.520
I look like I got money to you?

17:04.525 --> 17:06.278
You're gonna sit in jail
until this whole thing is over.

17:06.283 --> 17:08.112
So what're you trying to tell me to do?

17:08.117 --> 17:10.853
- Cop out? You a cop out lawyer?
- If you take a plea...

17:10.858 --> 17:12.275
No. No!

17:13.858 --> 17:16.645
Look, man, you even think
about telling me to cop out...

17:16.650 --> 17:18.687
You better go out there
and get me my probation.

17:18.692 --> 17:20.103
I'm gonna really try here, Leroy.

17:20.108 --> 17:22.937
Let me be clear, probation
is not gonna be on the table.

17:22.942 --> 17:24.008
Then I ain't takin' it.

17:24.525 --> 17:25.995
Last time you got arrested for stealing,

17:26.000 --> 17:27.737
- you got a 30-day sentence.
- Mmm-hmm.

17:27.742 --> 17:29.603
Which means the DA's office
is almost certainly

17:29.608 --> 17:31.270
gonna offer something
in excess of 30 days.

17:31.275 --> 17:33.895
- Is 30 the same as probation?
- Nope, on 30 you do 20.

17:33.900 --> 17:37.687
- Then I ain't takin' it!
- In which case we're gonna have to talk...

17:37.692 --> 17:40.770
Look, I don't wanna hear no more
shit about "in which case"!

17:40.775 --> 17:43.492
This is my case, and
I'm goin' home on it.

17:44.175 --> 17:47.270
- You hear me, blind man?
- Loud and clear.

17:47.275 --> 17:50.353
Then go out there and do your job
and get me some probation.

17:51.567 --> 17:54.900
- Yeah, let me, uh, see what I can do.
- See?

17:56.108 --> 17:59.433
See, that's funny,
'cause you can't see shit!

18:04.233 --> 18:06.228
I'm not gonna do this...

18:06.233 --> 18:07.812
- Sorry.
- What you got, Murdock?

18:07.817 --> 18:10.562
Morning, Sofija. I'm sure
you look lovely today.

18:10.567 --> 18:13.187
Uh, 8357, Bradford.

18:13.192 --> 18:14.858
Oh... Yeah.

18:15.775 --> 18:17.612
Stole some caramel corn from the bodega.

18:17.617 --> 18:18.617
Yep, that's the guy.

18:18.622 --> 18:21.005
Looks like we went 30 days
on this the last time,

18:21.010 --> 18:22.710
so how about we go 35?

18:22.715 --> 18:24.453
So, the guy's looking for probation.

18:24.458 --> 18:26.545
And I'm looking for Mr. Right.

18:26.550 --> 18:29.103
- You're not him by any chance, are you?
- Maybe for probation.

18:29.108 --> 18:30.858
Or how about you remind your client

18:30.863 --> 18:32.395
that the whole point of deterrents...

18:32.400 --> 18:35.178
A totally discredited penal philosophy,
by the way, but okay.

18:35.183 --> 18:37.146
...  is that sentences go up,

18:37.151 --> 18:40.020
and not down, when you
continue to commit crimes.

18:40.025 --> 18:41.270
Also, deterrence works.

18:41.275 --> 18:43.445
His rap sheet would suggest otherwise.

18:43.450 --> 18:44.687
Maybe we haven't been harsh enough.

18:44.692 --> 18:46.437
Or maybe the whole idea
relies on the theory that

18:46.442 --> 18:48.812
people are actually thinking about
the consequences of their actions,

18:48.817 --> 18:49.895
which I can assure you,

18:49.900 --> 18:52.900
having spent a full five minutes
with Mr. Bradford, he was not.

18:53.817 --> 18:56.028
Can I go five days community
service on the trespass?

18:56.033 --> 18:59.103
Sure. Well, uh, if... if
you don't like deterrents,

18:59.108 --> 19:01.076
how about incapacitation?

19:01.081 --> 19:03.145
Let's just keep him off
the streets for 35 days.

19:03.150 --> 19:04.728
Come on, Sofija, you really
wanna prove a point

19:04.733 --> 19:07.562
over some stolen caramel corn
on Latvian Heritage Day?

19:07.567 --> 19:08.803
How'd you know I was Latvian?

19:08.808 --> 19:11.189
Pretty sure you snuck a piece
of honey cake for breakfast.

19:11.867 --> 19:13.145
- Wow.
- It's a blind thing.

19:13.150 --> 19:15.270
- Mmm.
- You know, heightened senses and all.

19:15.275 --> 19:18.103
Mmm. I can imagine wanting to know
a little bit more about that.

19:18.108 --> 19:20.117
Plus, with a name like Ozola...

19:20.983 --> 19:23.270
Well, given your cultural sensitivity

19:23.275 --> 19:24.662
and your very impressive nose,

19:24.667 --> 19:25.912
I'll give your guy 20 days.

19:25.917 --> 19:27.395
Mmm...

19:27.400 --> 19:29.187
He's really stuck on probation.

19:29.192 --> 19:30.978
Did you remind him that the last time

19:30.983 --> 19:33.203
that he actually got probation,
which was by the way,

19:33.208 --> 19:35.020
- 11 cases ago by my count...
- Yeah.

19:35.025 --> 19:36.650
It only took him two months

19:36.655 --> 19:38.620
before his PO violated
him for failure to report?

19:38.625 --> 19:40.412
What can I say? The guy
has strong preferences.

19:40.417 --> 19:41.442
Yeah, well, so do I.

19:42.108 --> 19:43.853
So, how about this 20 days?

19:43.858 --> 19:47.037
On which he does 15, minus
today. You're really saying

19:47.042 --> 19:48.395
from a philosophical point of view,

19:48.400 --> 19:50.562
two weeks as opposed to probation?

19:50.567 --> 19:53.870
Only you, Murdock. Arguing philosophy
in criminal court arraignments.

19:53.875 --> 19:56.895
You started it. And while we're
on it, isn't it worth pointing out

19:56.900 --> 19:59.603
that the name of the crime we're
dealing with here is "petty larceny"?

19:59.608 --> 20:01.312
From the French, petit. Meaning...

20:01.317 --> 20:04.103
All right, one time only,
last and final offer.

20:04.108 --> 20:06.333
- Mr. Bradford can have ten days.
- Yes!

20:07.150 --> 20:08.228
Thank you.

20:08.233 --> 20:10.793
- See, I knew you believed in redemption.
- Oh, I don't. I don't.

20:11.283 --> 20:14.228
- But I do hope he appreciates you.
- Thank you.

20:24.025 --> 20:26.108
What? No.

20:27.258 --> 20:28.258
What?

20:29.817 --> 20:30.817
Who?

20:32.107 --> 20:33.507
No, no, that guy's an idiot.

20:33.512 --> 20:35.645
No, no, just you. Just
you there at six o'clock.

20:35.650 --> 20:39.103
Officer Powell? I thought
I recognized that voice.

20:39.108 --> 20:40.317
Shit, I gotta go.

20:41.525 --> 20:43.287
Counselor Murdock. Funny how we keep

20:43.292 --> 20:45.212
- finding each other like this.
- Yeah. Isn't it?

20:45.858 --> 20:47.983
You, uh, doing the Lord's work today?

20:49.192 --> 20:50.192
Yeah.

20:50.900 --> 20:53.437
Hey, you couldn't have a weak
link out there, could you?

20:53.442 --> 20:55.562
- What?
- Or, I don't know, maybe it was pride.

20:55.567 --> 20:57.103
Ayala made you look bad, didn't he?

20:57.108 --> 20:59.103
Actually, he flat out embarrassed you,

20:59.108 --> 21:01.367
and you can't have that at the NYPD.

21:01.372 --> 21:02.603
Is that why you did it?

21:05.758 --> 21:07.562
You have yourself a nice day, Counselor.

21:07.567 --> 21:08.608
He had a family.

21:09.233 --> 21:11.692
He had a future. And you
took that away from him.

21:16.825 --> 21:19.437
You can't see this badge, Counselor,
'cause you're fuckin' blind,

21:19.442 --> 21:21.525
but my grandfather wore this badge,

21:22.150 --> 21:24.812
my father wore this badge,
my brother wears this badge,

21:24.817 --> 21:27.062
four of my fuckin' cousins
wear this badge,

21:27.067 --> 21:29.062
they're all knuckleheads,
but they're good cops.

21:29.067 --> 21:31.067
So I wear this fucking badge
with honor, Counselor.

21:31.775 --> 21:33.796
And I don't know nothin' about nothin'

21:33.801 --> 21:36.145
to do with what happened
to Hector Ayala.

21:42.650 --> 21:44.067
But here's somethin' that I know.

21:44.858 --> 21:47.812
An attorney who assaults
a police officer?

21:47.817 --> 21:49.883
Who obstructs an active investigation?

21:50.650 --> 21:53.062
Not somethin' that the Bar
Association's gonna take lightly

21:53.067 --> 21:54.645
- if you catch my meaning.
- Mmm.

21:54.650 --> 21:57.103
Not to mention some of my
more excitable colleagues

21:57.108 --> 21:58.603
- on the force.
- Ah, yeah.

21:58.608 --> 22:01.176
Only... you'd have to bring a few more

22:01.181 --> 22:03.067
than the last time we met, wouldn't you?

22:05.150 --> 22:07.567
All right. I'll be seein'
you, Counselor.

22:16.400 --> 22:18.483
New York City.

22:20.525 --> 22:22.108
The greatest city on Earth.

22:23.317 --> 22:25.900
The heart of finance, publishing.

22:26.442 --> 22:28.192
International diplomacy.

22:30.192 --> 22:33.400
But I think we've lost
something along the way.

22:36.067 --> 22:37.192
Industry.

22:38.275 --> 22:40.233
The pride of the working class.

22:40.858 --> 22:43.270
If I say Red Hook, what
words come to mind?

22:43.275 --> 22:44.737
- Graves.
- Decrepit.

22:44.742 --> 22:46.228
I mean, it's dirty, too.

22:46.233 --> 22:49.853
Yes. This port is a black eye
on the face of this city.

22:51.233 --> 22:52.733
Has been for a while.

22:54.483 --> 22:56.067
I think we can do better.

22:57.233 --> 23:00.228
I'm talkin' about a complete
structural overhaul.

23:00.233 --> 23:02.442
- That's not an option.
- A total transformation.

23:02.991 --> 23:04.481
I told the people of this city I was

23:04.486 --> 23:06.062
gonna come out of the gate strong,

23:06.067 --> 23:07.687
that's exactly what I'm gonna do.

23:07.692 --> 23:10.062
Hell yeah, sir.

23:10.067 --> 23:13.692
Daniel, I want you to
organize a press conference.

23:15.067 --> 23:16.728
I wanna get this message
out immediately.

23:16.733 --> 23:18.895
With all due respect,

23:18.900 --> 23:22.078
you can't just decide something
and then speak it into existence.

23:22.083 --> 23:23.312
And why is that, Sheila?

23:23.317 --> 23:25.953
This is city government.
There are processes.

23:25.958 --> 23:27.317
Yes, processes.

23:28.608 --> 23:30.650
I don't have much use for red tape.

23:31.317 --> 23:34.520
I know you're used
to a different approach,

23:34.525 --> 23:37.428
but that's not how
it works in this office.

23:37.433 --> 23:39.728
These things take time, patience.

23:39.733 --> 23:41.228
What's your opinion, Daniel?

23:41.233 --> 23:43.670
Opinions are above his pay grade.

23:43.675 --> 23:45.627
Besides, there was another mob shooting

23:45.632 --> 23:47.792
yesterday not 50 feet from here.

23:48.192 --> 23:52.103
The third one this month. The
violence makes people uneasy.

23:52.108 --> 23:55.312
This is an ambitious goal.
It's a worthy goal,

23:55.317 --> 23:56.397
I'm not saying we shouldn't do it,

23:56.402 --> 23:59.520
I'm just saying we
need to start smaller.

23:59.525 --> 24:01.353
That could be our next campaign slogan.

24:03.650 --> 24:07.858
I hear you saying that
my plan is improbable,

24:08.442 --> 24:09.942
but not impossible.

24:10.400 --> 24:12.092
You're giving me problems.

24:12.942 --> 24:14.483
I want solutions.

24:16.525 --> 24:17.650
Where do we start?

24:18.692 --> 24:24.853
I suppose we would need
to conduct a feasibility study.

24:24.858 --> 24:28.712
Land surveys, building
permits, zoning laws.

24:28.717 --> 24:32.587
Environmental impact.
Um, traffic issues.

24:32.592 --> 24:35.812
The council will want to know
that this project is viable.

24:35.817 --> 24:37.145
Yes, let's commission that study.

24:37.150 --> 24:39.228
We can't do that without
the council's approval.

24:39.233 --> 24:40.603
- Then get the council to...
- No.

24:40.608 --> 24:43.437
And we can't get
their approval until we ask

24:43.442 --> 24:45.983
the public advocate
to put it on the docket.

24:46.525 --> 24:48.478
- That's the first step?
- Yes, sir.

24:48.483 --> 24:50.067
Let's take that step.

24:51.167 --> 24:52.353
Yes, sir.

24:52.358 --> 24:55.603
In the meantime, sir, we do
have a full day in front of us.

24:55.608 --> 24:57.978
Full days, I like. I'm all yours.

25:01.483 --> 25:04.353
- Uh, thank you, Mr. Mayor.
- Yes.

25:08.442 --> 25:11.942
I... I was basically gonna say
everything that you did, so...

25:13.733 --> 25:16.603
She's right about one thing.

25:16.608 --> 25:19.478
Now what's happening down here
is a bigger problem than you realize.

25:19.483 --> 25:22.145
The other bosses will
continue to create havoc

25:22.150 --> 25:26.025
until one of them is sentenced
or they all die.

25:34.442 --> 25:37.020
- Great news.
- You got me that probation.

25:37.025 --> 25:39.895
Nope. I got you ten days, on
which you do seven, minus today,

25:39.900 --> 25:42.345
you get the weekend bounce back
and you are out on Friday.

25:42.350 --> 25:44.470
- How is that great news?
- Come on, Leroy,

25:44.475 --> 25:47.395
the least you've gotten
in your last ten cases is 20 days.

25:47.400 --> 25:49.728
Anything below 30 is a gift,
ten is a miracle.

25:49.733 --> 25:51.895
Look, I said probation,
and I meant probation!

25:51.900 --> 25:53.245
You took the stuff, Leroy.

25:53.250 --> 25:55.230
There is no probation to be had here.

25:55.235 --> 25:56.687
This is the best deal you're gonna get,

25:56.692 --> 25:59.187
so you tell me, how is this not
a "Good job, counselor" situation?

25:59.192 --> 26:01.012
So, you just wanna
shove my ass into jail

26:01.017 --> 26:03.026
and I'm supposed to thank you?

26:04.383 --> 26:06.417
You just don't get it, do you?

26:07.442 --> 26:09.317
This shit never ends!

26:10.217 --> 26:12.900
I've been jerked around
by the system my whole life.

26:13.525 --> 26:16.117
Last time I got 30 days,
know what happened?

26:17.567 --> 26:21.192
I missed my SSI appointment
and they cut my benefits.

26:22.733 --> 26:25.942
Bad enough trying to live off food
stamps, but when they cut it,

26:26.567 --> 26:29.192
man, it takes forever
to get that shit back regular.

26:33.150 --> 26:35.993
Then you gotta start
eating throw away crap

26:35.998 --> 26:37.818
from supermarket dumpsters,

26:40.025 --> 26:41.883
begging for change,

26:42.692 --> 26:43.817
for food.

26:46.258 --> 26:49.150
And yeah, just once,

26:50.317 --> 26:51.567
I want a dessert.

26:52.442 --> 26:56.492
Something that don't taste like crap.
Something that tastes real good.

26:58.842 --> 27:00.717
So, why'd I get the caramel corn?

27:02.358 --> 27:04.633
I like that shit, and it tastes good.

27:06.692 --> 27:10.228
And for that, they're willing
to spend five times more

27:10.233 --> 27:13.192
to lock me up than they are
willing to spend to feed me.

27:14.483 --> 27:17.275
And you come in here
and tell me that that's a gift?

27:18.483 --> 27:19.983
That I should thank you?

27:22.817 --> 27:23.858
You're right.

27:34.342 --> 27:36.300
It don't matter anyway.

28:36.858 --> 28:39.187

28:51.125 --> 28:53.562
and I will be here long
after you're both gone.

28:53.567 --> 28:55.978

29:14.617 --> 29:18.687
Thank you, Mr. Mayor.
Now, for our next one...

29:18.692 --> 29:21.937
No, no, no. No, that's...
that's... that's fine. Fine.

29:21.942 --> 29:23.650
Such talent. And, again,

29:24.525 --> 29:26.442
you were wonderful. And, uh...

29:26.942 --> 29:30.067
as they say, "the city never sleeps".

29:36.025 --> 29:38.520
Everything ready for the
CleanGreen Haulers meeting?

29:38.525 --> 29:41.312
Actually, sir, we've had
to pull that off the calendar.

29:41.317 --> 29:43.700
- There's a small wrinkle.
- What's that?

29:45.025 --> 29:46.520
They're calling you a union buster,

29:46.525 --> 29:48.983
so we've broomed the meeting
off the schedule.

29:49.550 --> 29:52.520
We can do it quietly in a neutral
place sometime soon.

29:52.525 --> 29:53.770
Somebody screwed up.

29:53.775 --> 29:54.937
Leaks happen.

29:54.942 --> 29:56.817
Not in my administration it doesn't.

29:57.767 --> 30:00.767
I want an all hands meeting. Now!

30:01.650 --> 30:03.103
Where am I?

30:03.108 --> 30:04.853
It's the Latvian Cultural Center.

30:04.858 --> 30:08.228
It's on your calendar.
Latvian Heritage Day?

30:08.233 --> 30:10.770
What do I care about Latvian Heritage?

30:10.775 --> 30:13.812
You care because it is
an important constituency.

30:13.817 --> 30:15.420
You won by 16 points

30:15.425 --> 30:17.270
which actually mattered in Queens.

30:17.275 --> 30:18.525
I'm not in the mood.

30:19.317 --> 30:21.853
Respectfully, Mr. Mayor,
this is the job.

30:21.858 --> 30:24.478
Ladies and gentlemen,
and honored guests,

30:24.483 --> 30:28.270
I present to you, the Mayor
of New York City, Wilson Fisk.

30:43.925 --> 30:45.875
"Mayor Garbage?" Is that it?

30:46.542 --> 30:47.883
Is that your best?

30:48.483 --> 30:53.103
You are all here to help me
execute my promises.

30:53.108 --> 30:56.520
My promises to the people!
Simple promises!

30:56.525 --> 31:00.187
I will find out which
one of you leaked this.

31:00.192 --> 31:01.545
I will find out!

31:01.550 --> 31:04.353
It was me, sir. I screwed up.

31:04.358 --> 31:05.603
Damn it.

31:05.608 --> 31:09.062
I completely made a mistake.
This entire thing is my fault.

31:12.758 --> 31:14.750
Everybody out! Out!

31:17.858 --> 31:19.558
You stay! Right here.

31:20.233 --> 31:21.400
Sheila, I said out.

31:22.633 --> 31:25.478
He's mine, sir. Whatever
he did, it's on me.

31:25.483 --> 31:28.437
Okay, fine. Suit yourself.
You can go down with the ship.

31:28.442 --> 31:31.353
I... I wanna apologize,
I didn't mean to do it.

31:31.358 --> 31:34.353
I know that won't make it right.
I know that nothing can.

31:34.358 --> 31:38.062
But I went out to a club
till 4:30, maybe even 5:00,

31:38.067 --> 31:41.937
and I had a couple of...
Look, I had a lot to drink,

31:41.942 --> 31:45.495
tequila and in the spirit
of total honesty,

31:45.500 --> 31:48.112
- there was some ketamine.
- You should probably stop.

31:48.117 --> 31:50.770
I was drunk and stupid and I didn't
mean to do it, but I did do it,

31:50.775 --> 31:52.078
and I know that's unforgivable,

31:52.083 --> 31:54.270
and I'm not even asking for forgiveness,

31:54.275 --> 31:56.650
because... I can't
even forgive myself...

31:57.400 --> 31:59.408
'cause... 'cause the thing
is, you're right.

32:00.400 --> 32:03.817
I don't deserve this job.
And I never did.

32:05.150 --> 32:07.777
So, you're right to fire me or punish me

32:07.782 --> 32:09.375
or do whatever you're gonna do.

32:11.025 --> 32:13.983
And I just... I wanna say
that I'm eternally loyal

32:15.025 --> 32:17.728
and forever grateful for the opportunity

32:17.733 --> 32:19.028
and I'll spend the rest of my life

32:19.033 --> 32:21.001
regretting how badly I screwed it up.

32:21.775 --> 32:23.900
I... I believe in you.

32:24.733 --> 32:28.478
You'll have my vote forever
and whatever happens to me,

32:28.483 --> 32:30.103
I'll do whatever I can from afar

32:30.108 --> 32:33.400
to support you and your mayorship.

32:42.150 --> 32:44.687
Yeah, I'm... I'm not gonna fire you.

32:44.692 --> 32:46.228
I'll pack my things right away, sir.

32:46.233 --> 32:47.692
I said, I'm not gonna fire you.

32:49.158 --> 32:50.158
Or you, Sheila.

32:51.275 --> 32:54.483
I've been around a lot of,
let's just say...

32:55.483 --> 32:57.550
I know how unreliable people can be.

33:00.192 --> 33:03.150
I've learned that loyalty and courage,

33:04.150 --> 33:05.562
two qualities that are...

33:05.567 --> 33:06.567
well...

33:08.150 --> 33:09.812
not easily replicated.

33:09.817 --> 33:11.853
Sir, I don't deserve to...

33:11.858 --> 33:13.420
Um, Daniel, just shut up.

33:13.425 --> 33:15.917
Are you trying to argue
yourself out of a job?

33:18.150 --> 33:19.150
No.

33:20.317 --> 33:21.317
I'm not.

33:22.317 --> 33:23.358
I'm sorry, sir.

33:30.400 --> 33:32.900
In the fullness of time,
you'll make a better man.

33:34.150 --> 33:38.358
That said, if you ever do
anything like that again,

33:38.942 --> 33:41.608
it will be the last thing
that you ever do.

33:42.650 --> 33:44.150
Do you understand?

33:47.025 --> 33:48.025
Yes, sir.

33:49.108 --> 33:50.108
Loud and clear.

33:51.817 --> 33:54.192
It'll never happen again.

34:02.650 --> 34:03.820
Take two.

34:03.825 --> 34:05.395
Mayor Fisk, you never see him.

34:05.400 --> 34:07.853
Every week it seems like
he's involved in a new scandal.

34:07.858 --> 34:09.803
I mean, look what just
happened with the garbage.

34:09.808 --> 34:12.187
And look at all the garbage
on the street, you know.

34:12.192 --> 34:15.603
How can we trust a guy like that
who makes all of these promises

34:15.608 --> 34:17.042
to actually have our back?

34:28.317 --> 34:30.895
- Projectile?
- Not recovered.

34:30.900 --> 34:33.062
9 millimeter to the temple.
Execution style.

34:35.674 --> 34:37.550
Single kill shot at extreme close range

34:37.555 --> 34:38.978
and no one found the casing?

36:51.650 --> 36:52.853
Hello?

37:04.525 --> 37:05.525
Christ.

37:07.475 --> 37:09.020
I know you are in...

37:09.025 --> 37:10.603
It's me! It's me!

37:10.608 --> 37:12.353
Frank! Frank! Frank!

37:12.358 --> 37:14.478
It's me. It's Matthew.

37:18.550 --> 37:19.550
Goddamn it!

37:21.275 --> 37:23.395
- What're you doing here?
- How you been? Good?

37:26.483 --> 37:27.525
Peachy.

37:36.158 --> 37:38.603
- What do you want?
- A client of mine was shot, Frank.

37:38.608 --> 37:42.520
Guess whose logo I found
on the bullet casing?

37:44.608 --> 37:46.228
Oh, for Christ's sake.

37:46.233 --> 37:48.520
Bunch of bullshit fanboys, huh?

37:48.525 --> 37:51.317
Yeah, and a lot of them are cops.

37:52.108 --> 37:54.187
- What does that got to do with me?
- Yeah.

37:54.192 --> 37:56.708
Nothing to do with you, right. Silly me.

37:59.200 --> 38:01.692
- Nice place you got here.
- Hmm. Appreciate that.

38:06.275 --> 38:09.083
Although, here's a thought.
You know you could use

38:09.817 --> 38:12.983
all this to be of service.

38:13.692 --> 38:18.025
Yeah. Be of service, huh?

38:19.067 --> 38:22.275
Are you... are you of service, Red?

38:22.817 --> 38:23.900
Did you serve?

38:24.900 --> 38:27.187
You prance around the city
in a Halloween costume

38:27.192 --> 38:28.687
beating the snot out of bad guys.

38:28.692 --> 38:30.687
Hey, thank you for your service!

38:30.692 --> 38:32.520
I mean you could help people,
you could save lives.

38:32.525 --> 38:33.733
I... I did that.

38:34.400 --> 38:36.067
I was down range, Red.

38:37.400 --> 38:38.645
Look at what it got me.

38:38.650 --> 38:41.170
Oh, I apologize. I didn't realize
you were a victim in all this.

38:44.108 --> 38:46.395
I didn't use that pussy-ass
word my entire life,

38:46.400 --> 38:48.187
you don't put it in my mouth,
you understand that?

38:48.192 --> 38:49.853
All right, so you tell me
what's going on, buddy.

38:49.858 --> 38:51.562
What're you doing down
here day after day,

38:51.567 --> 38:53.120
- just hiding out?
- I ain't hiding from shit!

38:53.125 --> 38:54.953
- You walked in, I'm right here.
- Plotting your next kill?

38:54.958 --> 38:56.995
- You're goddamn right.
- Great. How is that working out?

38:57.000 --> 38:59.483
You wanna go out there
on the street, have at it!

38:59.983 --> 39:04.000
But I do not have time for
your candy-ass hero shit.

39:04.525 --> 39:06.562
- Is that clear?
- Yeah. Loud and clear.

39:06.567 --> 39:08.983
- Yeah?
- Sorry to waste your time.

39:11.525 --> 39:12.525
Yeah.

39:13.633 --> 39:16.245
- I'll tell you what I think, Red.
- Tell me. Tell me what you think.

39:16.250 --> 39:18.042
I don't think you came here for my help.

39:22.692 --> 39:24.437
See. I think you want my permission.

39:26.817 --> 39:30.192
You wanna get your hands on
somebody, huh? Wanna hurt 'em.

39:31.025 --> 39:32.579
Maybe you're a little bit scared.

39:32.584 --> 39:34.900
A little scared about what that means.

39:36.983 --> 39:39.437
That's an interesting take. I like it.

39:39.442 --> 39:41.853
But, uh, yeah, no. Sorry, buddy.
Way off on that one.

39:41.858 --> 39:45.020
Yeah, you're so full of shit,
Counselor. So full of shit.

39:45.025 --> 39:46.478
- You're guilty.
- Excuse me?

39:46.483 --> 39:49.192
Yeah, that guilt, that shame,
that's my home, Red.

39:49.983 --> 39:52.775
And I can see it on you, I can
smell it on you. It's all over you.

39:53.550 --> 39:55.145
I'm gonna come back another day, Frank,

39:55.150 --> 39:56.470
maybe catch you at a better time.

39:57.733 --> 40:00.478
You come at me with that
horseshit about saving lives.

40:00.483 --> 40:02.603
How 'bout that friend of
yours? You save his life?

40:04.692 --> 40:06.317
You lost him, didn't you, Red?

40:09.692 --> 40:11.895
- It's not about him.
- Then say his name.

40:11.900 --> 40:14.275
It's not about him. It's not about him.

40:15.400 --> 40:17.687
Ah, for Christ's sake, say his name!

40:17.692 --> 40:20.750
Say his name, you coward, say his name!

40:21.108 --> 40:22.400
It's not about him?

40:22.900 --> 40:24.728
You hate yourself. It's eating you up

40:24.733 --> 40:27.270
because you ain't done
a goddamn thing about it, so...

40:27.275 --> 40:29.103
Oh, oh.

40:29.108 --> 40:30.853
Goddamn it. Goddamn you.

40:34.400 --> 40:37.145
Sorry, I apologize.

40:37.150 --> 40:38.483
What are you sorry for?

40:40.650 --> 40:42.483
First honest thing you did, Red.

40:44.067 --> 40:45.400
- It's not about him.
- No.

40:45.942 --> 40:48.150
Okay?

40:49.608 --> 40:50.775
It's all about him.

40:53.442 --> 40:54.817
He talks to you, dudn't he?

40:56.983 --> 40:58.108
You hear his voice.

40:58.900 --> 41:00.025
You do, don't you?

41:01.067 --> 41:03.775
Every time I stop moving,
I still hear my little boy.

41:05.692 --> 41:06.692
I see him.

41:09.133 --> 41:10.592
And I hear his voice.

41:12.858 --> 41:14.233
He says, "Get 'em, Daddy.

41:15.525 --> 41:17.442
Every last single one of 'em, get 'em".

41:18.108 --> 41:19.858
That's why I do what I do.

41:21.108 --> 41:23.770
And that's why I see it in you.
That's why I see it in you

41:23.775 --> 41:25.770
because you know you
didn't do a goddamn thing

41:25.775 --> 41:27.103
and it's gonna keep eating at you.

41:27.108 --> 41:29.312
It's gonna keep eating,
and eating, and eating.

41:29.317 --> 41:31.478
There's no getting away
with it, you understand?

41:37.108 --> 41:38.187
I ran him down.

41:38.192 --> 41:39.520
Oh, for Christ's sake!

41:39.525 --> 41:40.945
I did what I had to do.

41:40.950 --> 41:42.895
And I let the system
take care of the rest...

41:42.900 --> 41:45.228
Oh! You and your Goddamn sy...

41:45.233 --> 41:47.067
You and your Goddamn system!

41:47.650 --> 41:48.728
Christ!

41:48.733 --> 41:52.145
So what now? Every day
Bullseye goes to the chow hole,

41:52.150 --> 41:53.283
eats his slop,

41:53.288 --> 41:56.145
you know he gets to breathe
the same air that you breathe.

41:56.150 --> 41:58.650
- You feel good about that?
- He got life!

42:08.275 --> 42:11.400
How 'bout old Foggy? He get life?

42:13.775 --> 42:15.233
Foggy...

42:18.150 --> 42:19.150
He was the...

42:20.025 --> 42:21.983
kindest, purest soul I ever met.

42:22.900 --> 42:24.400
And guys like you and me,

42:25.150 --> 42:29.942
we can work a lifetime and
never measure up to his decency.

42:36.983 --> 42:38.067
Goodbye, Frank.

42:55.942 --> 43:00.553
So, when Dr. Glenn asked to talk...

43:00.558 --> 43:02.267
She asked if you felt safe with me.

43:04.983 --> 43:06.150
I assumed.

43:06.858 --> 43:09.608
It's what a prudent psychiatrist
would ask.

43:10.233 --> 43:11.483
I told her I did...

43:13.025 --> 43:14.150
and I wasn't lying.

43:14.858 --> 43:16.853
Well, I'm glad you feel that way.

43:16.858 --> 43:17.900
I do.

43:18.817 --> 43:19.942
But, Wilson...

43:23.067 --> 43:24.108
Should I?

43:29.192 --> 43:30.692
When I was a boy,

43:31.358 --> 43:35.025
I learned by watching my father.

43:36.067 --> 43:37.733
How to shake a man's hand.

43:38.942 --> 43:42.228
How to know when someone
intends to cheat you.

43:42.233 --> 43:44.483
I learned the power of persuasion.

43:46.108 --> 43:48.775
How to move men's minds...

43:52.400 --> 43:54.192
Or break their bodies.

43:55.983 --> 43:57.353
But forgiveness...

44:01.358 --> 44:03.150
That wasn't a part of who he was.

44:06.108 --> 44:09.650
No. I am trying.

44:11.692 --> 44:15.395
I would like for things
to be the way they were.

44:15.400 --> 44:18.233
I understand that
that may not be possible.

44:19.983 --> 44:21.192
People change.

44:24.525 --> 44:26.858
I'm not the same woman
I was when you left.

44:28.067 --> 44:29.358
No, you aren't, are you?

44:30.900 --> 44:33.400
You're something even
more extraordinary.

44:38.400 --> 44:41.603
If I didn't know any better, I'd
think you were trying to avoid me.

44:41.608 --> 44:42.895
I'm so sorry.

44:42.900 --> 44:44.603
I just got pulled into another meeting.

44:44.608 --> 44:46.520
You don't have to be sorry.

44:46.525 --> 44:47.525
Really?

44:48.317 --> 44:49.395
Maybe a tiny bit.

44:51.400 --> 44:52.853
It's funny how I...

44:54.442 --> 44:56.520
When I'm not sleeping over,
I don't worry about you.

44:56.525 --> 44:59.728
But you come home late one night
and my mind is spinning.

44:59.733 --> 45:01.853
I mean, "What if he fell
into the subway tracks?

45:01.858 --> 45:04.103
- Maybe somebody kidnapped him".
- Kidnapped?

45:04.108 --> 45:05.395
"Maybe he needed a Heimlich...

45:05.400 --> 45:07.440
... and there was no one to give it".

45:09.025 --> 45:11.645
- I'm excellent at the Heimlich.
- Oh, yeah?

45:11.650 --> 45:13.603
- Mmm-hmm.
- Well, I am sorry.

45:13.608 --> 45:16.312
I mean, I'm not sorry, I'm sorry
you know, whatever. Just...

45:17.650 --> 45:19.108
One of those days, I guess.

45:20.067 --> 45:22.096
A client who was proven innocent

45:22.101 --> 45:25.001
still ends up dead and
nobody seems to care.

45:26.817 --> 45:28.295
I know, I'm sorry about that, Matt.

45:28.300 --> 45:30.162
Another client's serving time at Rikers

45:30.167 --> 45:32.270
for stealing a bag of caramel corn.

45:32.275 --> 45:33.645
Sounds a bit excessive.

45:36.358 --> 45:37.983
You ever feel like you're, uh,

45:38.817 --> 45:40.967
pushing a rock up a hill

45:42.074 --> 45:44.614
and there's a bunch of people
on the other side pushing it back.

45:48.358 --> 45:49.520
How was your day?

45:49.525 --> 45:50.728
Oh, you know...

45:52.233 --> 45:56.103
A few garden variety neurotics
slash depressives

45:56.108 --> 45:59.812
plus a not so garden variety
couple in crisis?

45:59.817 --> 46:01.937
None of which you can tell me about.

46:01.942 --> 46:05.478
Well, you know, I can tell you pretty
much anything you wanna know.

46:05.483 --> 46:07.103
- Really?
- Hmm...

46:07.108 --> 46:09.358
I'd just have to kill you.

46:10.342 --> 46:13.592
You know, I got pretty used to
coming home to an empty apartment.

46:14.608 --> 46:15.812
And now?

46:15.817 --> 46:17.942
And now I can't imagine
you not being here.

46:20.733 --> 46:21.775
Good answer.

47:53.067 --> 47:56.437
Please... Mr. Fisk...

47:58.483 --> 47:59.525
Mayor Fisk.

48:03.067 --> 48:07.858
I was told forgiveness
is the highest form of love.

48:09.608 --> 48:10.692
I wonder...

48:12.192 --> 48:15.145
would you agree with that, Adam?

48:22.483 --> 48:24.775
Please... Fisk!

48:28.858 --> 48:29.942
Please.

48:30.775 --> 48:33.145
Please!

48:33.150 --> 48:35.025
Let me out!
