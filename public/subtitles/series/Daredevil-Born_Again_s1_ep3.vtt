WEBVTT

00:10.292 --> 00:11.583
Thank you, New York.

00:11.667 --> 00:14.167
<i>It's humbling to be speaking to you
as Mayor.</i>

00:14.250 --> 00:18.750
Vanessa's resistance
is hurting you with traditional voters.

00:18.833 --> 00:21.958
<i>My wife and I, we have work to do.</i>

00:22.042 --> 00:26.292
Dr. Glenn, allow me to introduce
Mayor and Mrs. Fisk.

00:26.375 --> 00:28.625
Hector Ayala?
You know, they're saying you killed a cop?

00:28.708 --> 00:30.625
<i>Look, I didn't push him, I swear.</i>

00:30.708 --> 00:32.045
<i>I'd still like to represent you.</i>

00:32.125 --> 00:33.708
Hector, he's not the man I married.

00:33.792 --> 00:34.792
<i>White Tiger?</i>

00:34.875 --> 00:35.875
<i>You neglect to tell me</i>

00:35.958 --> 00:38.753
- that you moonlight as a vigilante?
- Someone's gotta protect the streets.

00:38.833 --> 00:41.458
I need you to find the witness
that Hector saved on the platform.

00:42.833 --> 00:44.753
<i>Nicky. You're the only person
standing between</i>

00:44.833 --> 00:46.295
<i>Hector and consecutive life sentences.</i>

00:46.375 --> 00:47.583
Where is he?

00:47.667 --> 00:49.167
Sadly, he's no longer here.

00:50.750 --> 00:51.917
You don't want to do this.

01:04.667 --> 01:05.667
Thanks.

01:11.542 --> 01:13.667
They, bring you some food?

01:15.667 --> 01:16.667
No.

01:26.583 --> 01:29.583
Luquillo is a beach
near where I'm from in Puerto Rico.

01:30.667 --> 01:33.083
To me,
it's the most beautiful place on Earth.

01:33.167 --> 01:38.292
White sand, palm trees, and the coquis.

01:39.250 --> 01:40.500
It's a little tree frog.

01:41.417 --> 01:43.583
Doesn't croak. It sings its name.

01:49.958 --> 01:53.292
I laugh
because the tourists, man,

01:53.375 --> 01:56.042
they think it's noisy and annoying,

01:57.083 --> 02:00.625
but to us <i>boricuas,</i>
man, it's a magical sound.

02:02.708 --> 02:07.250
And the coqui, it mates for life, right?
So, every sunset...

02:10.583 --> 02:15.583
thousands of these frogs start calling out
to their one and only love.

02:19.833 --> 02:21.083
It's the music of the island.

02:23.875 --> 02:26.667
You're gonna see that beach again, Hector.
I promise.

02:27.708 --> 02:30.125
And you'll be reunited with your family.

04:39.292 --> 04:40.332
Yo, what's up?

04:43.042 --> 04:46.042
Be cool. It's a gimme.

04:46.125 --> 04:47.542
No one plays cowboy.

04:54.458 --> 04:56.542
Evenin', gentlemen.

04:57.042 --> 04:58.917
Whoo! Nippy, isn't it?

05:01.125 --> 05:04.417
I couldn't trouble you for the keys
to this fine vehicle, could I?

05:04.500 --> 05:06.333
- Here you go.
- Thank you very much.

05:06.417 --> 05:09.750
And, wallets, while you're at it.

05:14.958 --> 05:16.333
- Here you go.
- Thank you.

05:19.958 --> 05:21.167
You too, Susan.

05:21.250 --> 05:22.958
Do you know whose truck this is?

05:25.125 --> 05:26.500
Are you a hard man, are ya?

05:27.250 --> 05:28.458
Yeah.

05:30.167 --> 05:31.542
Silly wee bastard.

05:42.333 --> 05:45.750
I look over my shoulder, but I grew up
in the city. I'm not afraid,

05:45.833 --> 05:47.875
<i>but somebody invades my privacy,</i>

05:47.958 --> 05:52.292
I have no problem taking my piece
and putting it to their head. That's it.

05:52.375 --> 05:54.792
<i>Long, dark nights out here, man.</i>

05:54.875 --> 05:58.292
Good versus evil, evil versus evil,
good versus good.

05:58.375 --> 06:00.958
<i>Is New York gonna make it? I don't know.</i>

06:01.042 --> 06:03.500
<i>You want answers from me?
I don't have 'em, sorry.</i>

06:24.792 --> 06:28.708
I hear Bacon's Freud triptych
is coming up for auction... again.

06:31.125 --> 06:32.250
The yellow one.

06:34.583 --> 06:35.833
You remember.

06:37.083 --> 06:38.125
I remember.

06:39.792 --> 06:42.792
I could wash two hundred million
through that sale.

06:43.708 --> 06:47.542
I know that it hurts to just sit by,

06:47.625 --> 06:50.833
but I'm reaching for higher goals.

06:53.125 --> 06:54.125
Such as?

06:55.292 --> 06:57.417
Sorry to bother you, sir,

06:57.500 --> 07:01.417
but you wanted to be updated on anything
happening near the Red Hook Port.

07:01.500 --> 07:02.545
- Yes.
- Yeah.

07:02.625 --> 07:05.917
Last night, there was a double homicide
not half a mile from the port.

07:06.000 --> 07:08.625
Apparently, a hijacking gone wrong.

07:08.708 --> 07:12.500
It really doesn't help
sell the place as a destination.

07:12.583 --> 07:15.333
We should make the appropriate calls...

07:16.208 --> 07:20.625
and inspire Chief Gallo
to make it a priority.

07:22.875 --> 07:24.042
Yeah, we can try.

07:29.083 --> 07:32.875
They're misbehaving because
there's no one at the head of the table.

07:32.958 --> 07:37.625
Without you or me there,
they'll turn on each other.

07:39.042 --> 07:40.417
They're rats.

07:41.583 --> 07:45.375
Rats at the bottom of the barrel.
Let them kill each other.

07:45.458 --> 07:48.583
And when
they're done with each other,

07:48.667 --> 07:51.042
whoever is left standing
will come after you.

07:55.542 --> 08:01.875
That world, that kind of violence,
petty blood feuds...

08:05.917 --> 08:07.250
None of it is our concern.

08:50.125 --> 08:52.750
Yeah, okay.
I'll be right there.

08:58.833 --> 09:01.125
You know, you don't need
those glasses indoors, right?

09:01.208 --> 09:03.375
I'm sorry,
are you talking to me?

09:03.458 --> 09:04.500
Who's there?

09:07.500 --> 09:09.542
So, you're a blind lawyer who can fight.

09:12.167 --> 09:13.208
Officer Powell.

09:16.708 --> 09:19.212
You know, Murdock, I bet Judge Cooper
would be interested to hear

09:19.292 --> 09:21.333
that you're interfering
with a police investigation.

09:21.417 --> 09:22.833
I think you mean a shakedown.

09:22.917 --> 09:26.167
It doesn't exactly seem ethical.
I bet he'd throw you right off the case.

09:26.958 --> 09:28.542
Well, at least I won't go to jail.

09:28.625 --> 09:30.375
Witness tampering is a serious offense.

09:30.458 --> 09:33.338
Now, maybe you get lucky, and the DA only
slaps you with a misdemeanor...

09:33.958 --> 09:34.958
but I doubt it.

09:38.292 --> 09:39.875
I'll see you in court, Officer.

10:01.208 --> 10:05.042
I think you've misunderstood
the concept of a safe house.

10:05.417 --> 10:07.250
Probably got eyes on us.

10:07.333 --> 10:09.333
He says it relaxes him or whatever.

10:10.375 --> 10:11.625
That's what this is for.

10:12.250 --> 10:16.833
Hey! Cherry Cola,
you're back, man. Finally.

10:19.542 --> 10:22.833
This is it? Come on, man.

10:22.917 --> 10:26.042
First of all, it's not a party.
I'm not your man.

10:26.125 --> 10:29.208
And this is just for me to get you
on the stand without sweating and puking.

10:29.292 --> 10:32.250
Relax. I got you. Hey.

10:39.125 --> 10:42.875
For how long have you been with the NYPD,
Officer Powell?

10:42.958 --> 10:44.208
Just over 15 years.

10:44.958 --> 10:46.170
And in those 15 years,

10:46.250 --> 10:49.750
how many commendations of excellence
have you received?

10:49.833 --> 10:53.042
Three. I got one for integrity
and two for community service.

10:53.792 --> 10:57.542
Would you say it was unusual
for an officer of your seniority

10:57.625 --> 10:59.208
to be working on New Year's Eve?

10:59.292 --> 11:01.125
Well, I volunteered.

11:01.208 --> 11:04.833
Well, a lotta the guys in my precinct,
they got families, you know, kids,

11:04.917 --> 11:07.250
and mine are grown. Kel's too.

11:07.333 --> 11:10.583
Kel, Officer Shanahan, your partner?

11:10.667 --> 11:13.458
Yeah. We were assigned
to Washington Heights,

11:13.542 --> 11:16.208
and lotta the guys got sent down
to Times Square for the ball drop.

11:16.292 --> 11:20.083
Did you and Officer Shanahan
see much action that night?

11:20.167 --> 11:22.042
We didn't see any action

11:22.125 --> 11:24.542
until we got down
to the platform on 168th.

11:24.625 --> 11:26.583
What happened there?

11:27.375 --> 11:29.833
Well, we were just finishing up
a routine sweep.

11:29.917 --> 11:31.875
You know, the place was like a ghost town,

11:32.000 --> 11:34.583
and... the defendant,
he just came outta nowhere.

11:34.667 --> 11:37.295
He had this wild look in his eyes,
and when you're a cop long enough,

11:37.375 --> 11:40.292
you know what that look means,
and he starts running toward us.

11:42.417 --> 11:44.503
Did you tell
the defendant to stop?

11:45.792 --> 11:47.152
Yes, many times.

11:49.375 --> 11:50.667
Don't react, Hector.

11:52.708 --> 11:54.500
We yelled and flashed our badges,

11:54.583 --> 11:57.087
but he just kept on coming.
He starts pounding on us, and then...

11:57.167 --> 11:59.375
I feel Kel pull him off me.

12:00.125 --> 12:03.500
Next thing I know, the guy just takes Kel
and pushes him in front of the train.

12:06.167 --> 12:07.167
Like it was nothin'.

12:07.917 --> 12:09.087
Like it was nothing?

12:09.167 --> 12:10.667
Objection. Leading.

12:10.750 --> 12:12.630
Sustained.

12:15.042 --> 12:19.042
Officer Powell,
I know how hard this is for you.

12:19.708 --> 12:22.833
Me and Kel Shanahan,
we were partners for eight years.

12:23.625 --> 12:27.083
You know,
that's eight years of beers and kids,

12:27.167 --> 12:29.417
and just talking about how shitty
the Knicks are.

12:31.542 --> 12:33.792
Kel Shanahan was my best friend.

12:35.167 --> 12:36.667
And that's all over now.

12:38.750 --> 12:40.208
No further questions.

12:46.958 --> 12:48.417
Officer Powell, good morning, um...

12:49.000 --> 12:50.500
I'm told you have a black eye.

12:50.583 --> 12:52.917
- I hope everything is okay.
- Yeah, don't worry about it.

12:53.000 --> 12:55.042
You know,
there's this thing they say in boxing.

12:55.125 --> 12:57.417
The best cure for a black eye
is fast hands.

12:57.500 --> 12:58.837
- Objection.
- Sustained.

12:58.917 --> 13:00.625
Come on, Mr. Murdock.

13:00.708 --> 13:03.170
Officer Powell, I just wanna
make sure I'm clear on something.

13:03.250 --> 13:05.875
You testified that
before my client arrived at the station,

13:05.958 --> 13:07.292
the place was a ghost town.

13:08.167 --> 13:09.167
Yeah.

13:09.250 --> 13:11.875
Meaning you and your partner
were alone on the platform.

13:11.958 --> 13:13.125
Yes.

13:13.208 --> 13:14.753
Now,
language can be strange sometimes

13:14.833 --> 13:16.837
so I just want to make sure
we're saying the same thing here.

13:16.917 --> 13:19.750
By "alone," you mean
just the two of you, no one else?

13:19.833 --> 13:22.462
- That's right.
- There's no passenger waiting for a train?

13:22.542 --> 13:23.625
No.

13:24.833 --> 13:26.833
No busker playing a guitar?

13:27.708 --> 13:30.208
- No.
- Okay. So you're alone.

13:30.292 --> 13:31.500
No buskers or passengers.

13:32.458 --> 13:35.417
Which means there certainly wasn't
a confidential informant

13:35.500 --> 13:36.878
- you were roughing up.
- Objection!

13:36.958 --> 13:39.503
You better have
a good faith basis for this, Mr. Murdock.

13:39.583 --> 13:40.670
Yeah, I do, Your Honor.

13:40.750 --> 13:42.710
Tight leash,
if you get my meaning.

13:42.792 --> 13:45.875
Officer Powell, let's try this.
You ever met a man named Nicky Torres?

13:51.833 --> 13:53.125
I never heard of him.

13:53.208 --> 13:56.833
That's curious, 'cause as I understand it,
Nicky Torres is a confidential informant

13:56.917 --> 13:58.208
who used to work with the NYPD.

13:58.292 --> 14:01.500
In fact, he used to work with you
and Officer Shanahan directly.

14:03.917 --> 14:06.458
Officer Powell,
did you and Officer Shanahan

14:06.542 --> 14:09.667
have an arranged meeting with Nicky Torres
on the platform that night?

14:17.958 --> 14:19.417
I told you, I don't know him.

14:20.917 --> 14:22.333
Yeah. You did say that.

14:24.250 --> 14:25.375
Thank you.

14:30.708 --> 14:32.583
Torres cannot testify.

14:47.500 --> 14:48.667
He's almost ready.

14:49.375 --> 14:51.833
- What's he doin'?
- Should I be worried?

14:51.917 --> 14:52.958
Yep.

14:53.500 --> 14:55.083
Hey, you promised I'd be safe.

14:55.167 --> 14:57.500
You'll be fine if you stay out of sight.
Come on, let's go.

15:14.000 --> 15:16.500
Looking at the doors
isn't gonna get them here any faster.

15:17.375 --> 15:19.083
Who says I'm looking at the doors?

15:19.708 --> 15:21.208
They'll be here.

15:36.125 --> 15:37.375
All rise.

15:37.458 --> 15:40.833
Supreme Court State of New York,
part 20 is in session.

15:40.917 --> 15:43.250
The Honorable Fitzgerald Cooper presiding.

16:01.833 --> 16:04.125
- You good?
- Yeah.

16:24.708 --> 16:26.500
Mr. Murdock, call your witness.

16:28.792 --> 16:31.708
Just another second, Your Honor.

16:37.333 --> 16:38.333
Mornin', Officer.

16:38.417 --> 16:39.792
Get outta the van, asshole.

16:42.000 --> 16:43.083
Where is he?

16:46.125 --> 16:47.125
Open it.

16:55.583 --> 16:56.792
- You good?
- Yeah.

16:56.875 --> 16:58.000
Come on! Let's go!

17:03.417 --> 17:04.625
They're here.

17:12.250 --> 17:13.583
Impeccable timing, buddy.

17:20.792 --> 17:22.792
Would you state your name for the record?

17:22.875 --> 17:25.458
Yeah. My name's Nicky Torres.

17:26.125 --> 17:27.925
And, where do you live,
Mr. Torres?

17:28.750 --> 17:29.875
Washington Heights.

17:30.708 --> 17:33.042
So, are you close
to the 168th Street subway station?

17:33.625 --> 17:35.542
Yeah,
it's four blocks from my house.

17:36.292 --> 17:37.812
Where're you working right now?

17:38.542 --> 17:41.125
I'm between jobs at the moment.

17:41.208 --> 17:43.542
Right, you've had a rough
couple of years?

17:44.417 --> 17:46.750
Eighteen months ago,
I got pinched for dealing.

17:47.542 --> 17:51.208
I knew I shouldn't have done it,
but I got a kid. I needed money.

17:51.875 --> 17:54.250
So, you were looking
at a prison sentence.

17:54.917 --> 17:56.958
What happened with that case?

17:58.292 --> 17:59.750
It went away.

17:59.833 --> 18:01.375
Can you tell the jury why?

18:03.000 --> 18:06.083
I told the cops
I'd help 'em out sometimes.

18:06.958 --> 18:10.625
And by "help out," you mean
become a confidential informant?

18:12.208 --> 18:13.208
Yeah.

18:14.042 --> 18:17.167
Mr. Torres, is that what you were doing
on the night of New Year's Eve?

18:17.250 --> 18:20.583
Were you passing along information
to Officers Shanahan and Powell?

18:33.958 --> 18:35.458
Remembering you're under oath.

18:39.667 --> 18:41.833
No. I was home all night.

18:43.917 --> 18:45.295
Forgive me, I'm confused here.

18:45.375 --> 18:47.003
Previously, you stated pretty clearly that

18:47.083 --> 18:49.462
you were actually at the 168th Street
subway station being beaten

18:49.542 --> 18:51.212
- when Hector Ayala saved your life.
- Objection.

18:51.292 --> 18:52.378
- Objection!
- Sustained.

18:52.458 --> 18:54.003
He put himself in harm's way, didn't he?

18:54.083 --> 18:56.483
- Matt! Matt!
- Counsel, stand down!

19:03.583 --> 19:05.458
Well, this is bullshit.

19:06.333 --> 19:08.853
- Just end it.
- Well, what's it gonna be, Mr. Murdock?

19:09.833 --> 19:11.375
I withdraw the witness, Your Honor.

19:12.875 --> 19:14.792
Mr. Torres, you are dismissed.

19:46.000 --> 19:47.792
The mayor's 30 minutes late.

19:47.875 --> 19:49.292
He won't be joining us.

19:49.375 --> 19:51.875
Now, the shootout two days ago at the port

19:51.958 --> 19:54.792
is just the latest in a long line
of very noisy mistakes.

19:55.667 --> 19:59.875
Truck hijackings, violence at the docks,
a gang war...

19:59.958 --> 20:03.125
These are the headlines splashed across
the front page of <i>The Examiner.</i>

20:03.208 --> 20:04.708
It all ends today.

20:05.333 --> 20:07.875
We don't take orders from you, son.
That's not how things work.

20:08.750 --> 20:10.250
Luca.

20:11.667 --> 20:13.667
This is what you owe Viktor.

20:15.333 --> 20:16.417
Restitution.

20:22.750 --> 20:25.417
1.8. I like the sound of that.

20:25.500 --> 20:27.167
Are you out of your mind?

20:27.250 --> 20:29.045
Maybe next time, hire guys
who know how to jack a truck!

20:29.125 --> 20:30.962
Maybe you shouldn't have hired
a bunch of trigger-happy assholes.

20:31.042 --> 20:33.000
Enough! You're proving my point.

20:33.083 --> 20:37.500
All this arguing, bloodshed, chaos...
It's getting in the way.

20:37.583 --> 20:40.333
1.8. That's the number.

20:41.792 --> 20:43.625
Yeah? I got a better idea.

20:43.708 --> 20:46.417
How about I pay zero dollars to Viktor,
and you go tell Fisk

20:46.500 --> 20:49.083
if he's got something to say to me,
he can come tell me himself?

20:49.167 --> 20:51.583
I don't take orders
from the mayor's errand boy!

20:53.458 --> 20:57.292
I don't work for the mayor.
I work for the man.

21:00.500 --> 21:02.458
So he was fine
when we prepped him.

21:02.542 --> 21:04.708
He's an annoying pain in the ass,
but he was fine.

21:04.792 --> 21:06.042
So what the hell happened?

21:06.125 --> 21:09.208
Maybe the cops got to him,
or they threatened his kid.

21:09.292 --> 21:11.958
Or he was never on our side
in the first place.

21:12.042 --> 21:13.917
So what do we have without Nicky?

21:14.000 --> 21:17.667
Nothing. Our entire defense
just got flushed down the toilet.

21:19.417 --> 21:21.083
Maybe there's a paper trail,

21:21.167 --> 21:27.125
some kind of CI registration form
or a record of payments or something?

21:27.208 --> 21:29.458
We get that, we can recall him
as a hostile witness.

21:29.542 --> 21:31.917
I looked. There's nothin'.

21:32.000 --> 21:34.708
Powell did everything cash,
kept it all off the books.

21:34.792 --> 21:36.000
He testify for them?

21:36.083 --> 21:38.833
- Is there a case we can hang on him?
- Nothing I found.

21:39.792 --> 21:41.750
He's innocent. We put him on the stand.

21:42.875 --> 21:45.333
He tells his side of the story. The truth.

21:46.708 --> 21:49.417
And we hope the jury see him
the way we do.

21:51.667 --> 21:52.750
It's our only move.

21:54.375 --> 21:56.208
We're gonna need a lot more bourbon.

22:03.083 --> 22:05.667
What you're trying to do,
it's not going to work.

22:07.042 --> 22:08.042
Counseling?

22:12.875 --> 22:13.917
Tell me.

22:21.083 --> 22:22.792
I sent Buck to Luca

22:22.875 --> 22:26.708
to tell him to pay Viktor
1.8 restitution for the hijacking.

22:29.375 --> 22:31.958
Let's not fall into a place
where I don't trust you.

22:39.375 --> 22:41.708
I don't like watching
everything fall apart.

22:45.375 --> 22:48.208
I respect that.
You wanted to keep the peace.

22:50.167 --> 22:52.667
Sometimes, peace needs to be broken,

22:53.500 --> 22:55.708
and chaos must reign,

22:56.333 --> 22:59.875
just for a moment,
to build a stronger order.

23:00.500 --> 23:03.875
Is that what it is?
Chaos before a stronger peace?

23:03.958 --> 23:06.042
Or is it my penance? For what I did.

23:06.125 --> 23:08.375
- No.
- You're punishing me for Adam.

23:08.458 --> 23:11.378
- I'm not punishing you for anything!
- You're leaving me out in the cold.

23:18.250 --> 23:19.750
Thank you for your patience.

23:20.917 --> 23:23.542
Now, where were we?

23:33.333 --> 23:36.667
Mr. Ayala, how often would you say
you're at the 168th Street subway station?

23:37.375 --> 23:40.083
A few times a week.
It's close to the apartment.

23:40.167 --> 23:41.628
Were you there on New Year's Eve?

23:41.708 --> 23:42.792
Yes.

23:42.875 --> 23:45.475
Would you mind walking us through
what happened that night?

23:45.792 --> 23:49.167
Yeah, I bought
some flowers at <i>la bodega,</i>

23:49.250 --> 23:51.625
and I was heading down to the station.

23:51.708 --> 23:53.333
Where were you going, Mr. Ayala?

23:57.542 --> 23:58.875
Mr. Ayala?

23:58.958 --> 24:04.542
My wife and I,
we, live with my sister and my niece.

24:05.625 --> 24:08.042
Soledad and I, we've always dreamt
of having our own place,

24:08.125 --> 24:11.208
and I had finally saved up the money.

24:12.875 --> 24:16.750
I put a deposit down on a studio
in the South Bronx.

24:17.500 --> 24:20.875
It's not much, but it's ours.

24:21.833 --> 24:25.125
I was going there
to put the flowers there for the next day.

24:25.208 --> 24:27.500
'Cause you wanted to surprise your wife.

24:28.500 --> 24:30.000
Yes.

24:30.083 --> 24:33.500
Okay, so,
you were heading into the station.

24:33.583 --> 24:34.583
What happens next?

24:35.333 --> 24:36.333
I heard yelling.

24:36.417 --> 24:38.708
Sounded like someone
was in trouble, so I ran down...

24:39.375 --> 24:40.625
to see what was going on.

24:41.208 --> 24:42.208
What did you see?

24:42.792 --> 24:44.292
A man getting beat up.

24:44.375 --> 24:45.833
Did you know the man?

24:45.917 --> 24:48.792
No. And I never saw him again
until yesterday in court.

24:48.875 --> 24:50.667
And now I know his name is Nicky Torres.

24:53.375 --> 24:55.253
What about the men
who were doing the beating?

24:55.333 --> 24:57.167
- Did you know them?
- No.

24:57.250 --> 25:00.042
Did you know
they were police officers?

25:00.625 --> 25:04.542
No. No, I yelled at them to stop
and they didn't.

25:04.625 --> 25:06.417
So I ran down to help.

25:06.500 --> 25:08.375
And then,
everything just happened so fast.

25:08.458 --> 25:10.917
I tried to break it up,
then they started beating on me,

25:11.000 --> 25:12.128
and I tried to fight them off

25:12.208 --> 25:15.048
and then, all of a sudden, one of them
slipped and fell onto the tracks.

25:17.208 --> 25:18.333
I was just trying to help.

25:19.167 --> 25:21.250
I didn't want anyone to get hurt.

25:21.333 --> 25:22.653
Could've just walked away.

25:23.958 --> 25:25.375
Ignored the problem.

25:25.458 --> 25:28.167
You decided to risk your own safety
to help a stranger.

25:28.958 --> 25:30.458
Wasn't the first time, was it?

25:33.125 --> 25:35.253
- I don't understand.
- Well, I'm just saying

25:35.333 --> 25:37.750
that you've put yourself
in harm's way before. Many times.

25:37.833 --> 25:39.667
The question is why?

25:40.375 --> 25:41.417
Because he was in trouble.

25:41.500 --> 25:43.667
You intervened that night
'cause you're a hero.

25:43.750 --> 25:44.750
Matt, don't do this.

25:44.833 --> 25:46.167
Matt, don't do it.

25:46.250 --> 25:48.962
Mr. Ayala, yes or no. Are you
the vigilante known as the White Tiger?

25:49.042 --> 25:50.458
- Objection, Your Honor!
- Order!

25:50.542 --> 25:52.337
- Yes or no? Mr. Ayala?
- Order!

25:54.750 --> 25:56.750
Order in my court!

26:00.542 --> 26:02.792
Both of you, in my Chambers, now.

26:11.833 --> 26:14.625
Boy, you are a real slippery
piece of shit, you know that?

26:14.708 --> 26:17.250
You sat in that very spot,
and you misled me.

26:17.333 --> 26:19.083
You made representations to me,

26:19.167 --> 26:21.083
you conned me
into suppressing this information,

26:21.167 --> 26:24.000
you lectured me
about what's right and wrong,

26:24.083 --> 26:27.333
and then, you have the nerve to stand up
and make a mockery of my courtroom?

26:27.417 --> 26:28.753
That wasn't my intention, Your Honor.

26:28.833 --> 26:31.083
They somehow got to my star witness.
My hand was forced.

26:31.167 --> 26:34.250
What happened to all that lofty rhetoric
about "unfairly biasing the jury?"

26:34.333 --> 26:36.128
Hector's alter ego
is critical to this case.

26:36.208 --> 26:38.420
What he's done as the White Tiger
speaks to the strength of his character.

26:38.500 --> 26:39.920
- My God.
- It's well within my rights...

26:40.000 --> 26:42.253
Is there a Division of Hypocrisy
at Murdock and Associates?

26:42.333 --> 26:43.973
All right, stop it, both of you! Stop it.

26:45.125 --> 26:48.417
I can strike this from the record,
but that is pointless.

26:49.208 --> 26:50.667
I can declare a mistrial,

26:50.750 --> 26:53.042
but it's out already,
so I'd say that ship has sailed.

26:54.875 --> 26:56.333
Put me in quite a bind, Mr. Murdock.

26:56.417 --> 26:58.253
I didn't mean to disrespect the court,
Your Honor.

26:58.333 --> 26:59.417
Let me be clear.

27:00.292 --> 27:02.750
You blew open this door, Mr. Murdock.
Which means...

27:02.833 --> 27:05.625
Yeah. It's open season on my client.
I get it.

27:05.708 --> 27:07.125
Well, that's it.

27:08.125 --> 27:09.250
Thank you, Your Honor.

27:09.333 --> 27:10.933
Um...

27:11.792 --> 27:14.292
Just... I sit atop a pyramid

27:14.375 --> 27:16.333
of over 500 ADAs.

27:16.417 --> 27:18.462
You're not gonna be able
to stumble into traffic court

27:18.542 --> 27:20.292
without one of them up your ass.

27:20.375 --> 27:21.625
I hope it was worth it.

27:23.042 --> 27:26.583
<i>I don't think that
Mr. Ayala is gonna get a fair trial.</i>

27:26.667 --> 27:29.083
You know why? He's Puerto Rican.

27:29.167 --> 27:30.667
He's gonna single him out.

27:30.750 --> 27:34.375
<i>If you have enough evidence,
he should go to prison,</i>

27:34.458 --> 27:37.667
but give him a fair trial,
which I don't think he's gonna get it.

27:46.708 --> 27:48.125
You should've asked me first.

27:50.667 --> 27:51.667
I know.

27:54.333 --> 27:55.875
It wasn't your secret to tell.

27:58.875 --> 28:01.167
Just trying to keep you
outta prison, buddy.

28:01.750 --> 28:04.000
We were losing,
and I had to take a big swing.

28:08.417 --> 28:11.000
You know, Hector, if you are acquitted,

28:12.167 --> 28:13.875
your White Tiger days are over.

28:15.292 --> 28:19.792
I mean, you know that, right?
You can't... ever put that suit back on.

28:22.417 --> 28:23.833
I don't think you understand.

28:24.875 --> 28:28.542
Being the White Tiger
is more than just putting on a suit.

28:30.167 --> 28:31.333
It's who I am.

28:34.750 --> 28:35.750
It's a calling.

28:37.375 --> 28:40.792
I didn't choose it. It chose me.

28:41.833 --> 28:44.000
Might as well ask me to stop breathing.

28:46.375 --> 28:47.875
There are other ways to help.

28:49.125 --> 28:50.458
Other ways to contribute.

28:52.083 --> 28:53.958
Ways that don't require a mask.

28:54.792 --> 28:57.667
You have to think about your family now.
They need you.

28:58.583 --> 28:59.625
And for what it's worth,

28:59.708 --> 29:03.375
I think you might be surprised
at how much you don't miss being him.

29:09.208 --> 29:11.708
We had just dropped
our son off at a game.

29:11.792 --> 29:12.875
We were driving home,

29:13.458 --> 29:18.375
and this SUV, it runs a stop sign,
and it just plows right into us.

29:18.458 --> 29:20.250
The engine caught on fire.

29:21.250 --> 29:23.792
I tried to open the door,
but it was stuck.

29:24.542 --> 29:26.250
I thought for sure we were dead.

29:27.125 --> 29:30.042
Until all of a sudden,
I see someone running toward us.

29:30.125 --> 29:31.625
It was White Tiger.

29:34.792 --> 29:36.083
He saved our lives.

29:37.167 --> 29:39.083
A few weeks ago,
I was leaving work.

29:39.167 --> 29:42.250
It was late, and I have to cut through
this alley to get home.

29:42.875 --> 29:46.458
And this guy, he tries to grab me.
I screamed,

29:47.083 --> 29:48.625
but then I saw he had a knife.

29:48.708 --> 29:50.333
I was so scared.

29:51.292 --> 29:55.208
If White Tiger hadn't been there,
I don't know what would've happened.

29:56.167 --> 29:59.625
And now, let's hear
from a more objective party.

29:59.708 --> 30:03.792
This is a police report
filed by Officer Lucas Barlow.

30:03.875 --> 30:07.083
"On the night of October 2nd,
at 2:38 a.m.,

30:07.167 --> 30:09.625
"I responded
to an attempted burglary call.

30:09.708 --> 30:13.042
"When I arrived,
the suspect was hiding in an alley,

30:13.125 --> 30:17.042
"and before I could draw my weapon,
he attacked me without provocation.

30:17.125 --> 30:21.125
"We fought.
And then, White Tiger appeared.

30:21.208 --> 30:23.542
"He intervened, pulled the suspect off me,

30:23.625 --> 30:26.667
"then helped me
subdue and arrest the suspect."

30:29.458 --> 30:31.125
More police reports.

30:31.792 --> 30:35.208
Officer Reyes, Officer Wong,

30:35.292 --> 30:38.625
Officer Morales, Officer Grant...

30:39.375 --> 30:42.583
All of these tell a different version
of the same story,

30:42.667 --> 30:45.667
and it isn't the story of a man
who has a vendetta against the police.

30:46.792 --> 30:49.542
In fact, I think many of the people
in this room

30:49.625 --> 30:51.708
would consider White Tiger to be an ally.

30:53.875 --> 30:56.083
Mr. Ayala,
let's talk about Mr. and Mrs. Burgos.

30:56.792 --> 31:00.750
Why would you risk your life by running
toward a burning car to save strangers?

31:01.667 --> 31:03.042
It's the right thing to do.

31:03.667 --> 31:05.333
What about Gianna Moreno?

31:05.417 --> 31:07.625
You again put yourself in harm's way. Why?

31:09.792 --> 31:11.167
It's the right thing to do.

31:11.833 --> 31:13.753
And when you saw
Officer Barlow was in trouble,

31:13.833 --> 31:17.500
you ran in
when others would've run out. Why?

31:19.958 --> 31:21.438
It's the right thing to do.

31:24.625 --> 31:27.042
The police said
that Hector attacked them,

31:27.125 --> 31:29.708
that he came outta nowhere.
That's what they said.

31:30.583 --> 31:33.667
But why would Hector, the White Tiger...

31:35.333 --> 31:37.792
Why would he do this without the amulet

31:37.875 --> 31:40.500
that gives him
extraordinary strength and power?

31:41.083 --> 31:44.875
Would any of you walk into battle
with one arm tied behind your back?

31:47.458 --> 31:48.583
I wouldn't.

31:50.833 --> 31:54.917
Every night, Hector Ayala
goes out and risks his life

31:55.833 --> 31:59.083
to keep his neighborhood safe,
to protect his community.

32:00.542 --> 32:01.750
So ask yourselves,

32:02.875 --> 32:04.792
does this sound like the type of man

32:06.042 --> 32:08.500
who'd murder a police officer
in cold blood?

32:09.333 --> 32:11.917
He is a man of integrity.

32:12.000 --> 32:13.708
The community says so.

32:13.792 --> 32:16.708
The police say so.

32:18.417 --> 32:21.125
The mask doesn't make the man.

32:22.125 --> 32:25.708
And whether Hector Ayala's wearing
a White Tiger suit or not,

32:27.458 --> 32:28.750
he's a hero.

32:32.458 --> 32:33.583
Thank you.

32:39.417 --> 32:43.750
You know, every morning,
I get up, I kiss my wife, I call my kids,

32:43.833 --> 32:46.708
I go to work to serve the people
of this great city,

32:46.792 --> 32:48.208
I go to church every Sunday,

32:48.292 --> 32:51.083
I sit in my usual pew,
I give money to my parish,

32:51.167 --> 32:53.542
then I drive out to Queens
to see my mother.

32:53.625 --> 32:56.083
Does that make me a good person?

32:57.292 --> 32:59.000
That was a trick question.

32:59.083 --> 33:01.750
You see, frankly, it's a false premise.

33:01.833 --> 33:04.250
Good people can do bad things.

33:04.333 --> 33:07.000
Bad people can do good things.

33:07.083 --> 33:10.042
Humans... All of us.

33:10.125 --> 33:15.333
We're messy, complicated,
capable of good, capable of evil.

33:15.417 --> 33:19.542
Yes, Hector Ayala
might have done some good things.

33:19.625 --> 33:22.667
Does that make him incapable
of doing a bad thing?

33:24.958 --> 33:26.333
Of course not.

33:31.917 --> 33:35.333
Do you know what happens to a person
when they get hit by a train?

33:35.417 --> 33:39.167
When you have
200,000 pounds of steel slam into you,

33:39.250 --> 33:43.875
all of your bones break,
all of your organs are eviscerated,

33:43.958 --> 33:47.292
your body twists up
like a circus balloon full of blood.

33:47.375 --> 33:50.375
But here's the kicker, you're still alive.

33:51.708 --> 33:54.583
You don't actually die
until they back the train up,

33:54.667 --> 33:57.375
and then your body, it just bursts.

33:57.458 --> 34:00.875
And that is exactly what happened
to Officer Shanahan

34:00.958 --> 34:04.625
when Hector Ayala pushed him
in front of that train.

34:04.708 --> 34:07.292
But we're supposed to be okay
with that, right?

34:07.375 --> 34:10.125
Because he's done
some nice things for people.

34:11.875 --> 34:14.375
Because "it was the right thing to do."

34:16.792 --> 34:17.917
Look around you.

34:18.625 --> 34:23.458
These men and woman you see sitting here,
they're officers of the law.

34:23.542 --> 34:27.500
They took an oath to protect
even in the face of danger.

34:27.583 --> 34:31.708
And every single day,
these brave men and women show up

34:31.792 --> 34:35.250
to serve the people of this city,
to serve you, to serve me,

34:35.333 --> 34:38.833
and they do all that without a mask.

34:40.958 --> 34:45.333
If Hector's sole intent was to do good
for his community, why is he hiding?

34:46.625 --> 34:48.167
Because the last time I checked,

34:49.625 --> 34:51.708
real heroes don't need to hide.

35:50.667 --> 35:51.792
Hey.

35:52.500 --> 35:53.542
Hey.

35:55.292 --> 35:57.012
You okay?

36:08.958 --> 36:10.500
Has the jury reached a verdict?

36:10.583 --> 36:11.833
We have, Your Honor.

36:13.292 --> 36:14.833
Will the defendant please rise?

36:19.542 --> 36:22.542
In the matter of
the <i>People v. Hector Ayala,</i>

36:22.625 --> 36:25.083
on the count of murder
in the first degree,

36:25.167 --> 36:26.875
the jury finds the defendant...

36:31.708 --> 36:33.333
not guilty.

36:34.333 --> 36:36.667
On the count of murder
in the second degree,

36:36.750 --> 36:39.792
the jury finds the defendant not guilty.

36:41.375 --> 36:44.208
On the count of manslaughter
in the first degree,

36:44.292 --> 36:47.125
the jury finds the defendant not guilty.

36:50.458 --> 36:52.058
This matter is concluded.

36:56.792 --> 36:58.292
Congratulations, buddy.

36:59.292 --> 37:02.167
Mr. Ayala,
you're free to go.

37:03.083 --> 37:04.403
Thank you, Your Honor. Thank you.

37:08.000 --> 37:10.083
- Thanks.
- Congratulations, Hector.

37:13.833 --> 37:16.167
Thank you, all. Thank you.

37:16.250 --> 37:18.253
Mr. Murdock,
how do you respond to Mayor Fisk

37:18.333 --> 37:20.003
calling you
and all vigilantes cop killers?

37:20.083 --> 37:22.333
We're grateful
that justice was served, everyone.

37:22.417 --> 37:25.083
There's no further comment at this stage.
Thank you.

37:34.625 --> 37:35.792
Daniel.

37:35.875 --> 37:36.875
Yes, sir.

37:37.417 --> 37:39.375
Your friend, the journalist, BB...

37:39.458 --> 37:42.500
All due respect, sir,
we have people at the <i>Times.</i>

37:42.583 --> 37:44.083
Tell her I wanna see her again.

37:45.042 --> 37:46.250
Absolutely.

37:56.625 --> 37:58.125
Gotta love a man who cooks.

37:58.792 --> 38:01.125
And dinner for one in public
is a bit depressing.

38:01.208 --> 38:03.375
Tell me about it.

38:04.333 --> 38:07.250
So, is this the Matt Murdock victory lap?

38:07.333 --> 38:10.833
You win the Ayala case,
and now you get to enjoy the spoils?

38:10.917 --> 38:13.458
Not quite yet. One thing's missing.

38:14.500 --> 38:17.042
You see, my old partner and I,

38:17.125 --> 38:19.542
straight out of law school,
we were so broke,

38:19.625 --> 38:23.917
we pooled about everything we had together
for an office bottle of O'Melveny's.

38:25.458 --> 38:27.917
Only broke it open when we won.

38:28.542 --> 38:31.417
Needless to say, the first bottle lasted
a very long time.

38:34.875 --> 38:37.083
Just a nice little reminder that...

38:38.250 --> 38:41.125
once in a while, the system works.

38:44.583 --> 38:48.250
You're talking about your friend,
Foggy Nelson, right?

38:52.000 --> 38:53.083
Yeah.

38:54.708 --> 38:56.208
I was kinda wondering when you would.

38:59.292 --> 39:00.833
It's not easy.

39:01.792 --> 39:05.708
He certainly knew how to enjoy
the good moments when they came.

39:08.875 --> 39:10.083
Well then,

39:11.917 --> 39:13.708
here's to a man who cooks,

39:15.792 --> 39:16.958
a well-won case,

39:17.500 --> 39:20.292
and Foggy Nelson.

39:22.250 --> 39:24.875
May God hold them all
in the hollow of his hand.

39:34.292 --> 39:38.500
The Ayala verdict
is an absolute miscarriage of justice.

39:39.417 --> 39:42.625
Well, sir, a court and a jury
found him not guilty.

39:42.708 --> 39:47.042
Courts fail. Juries get it wrong.
I should know.

39:50.417 --> 39:53.833
And now, a masked vigilante,

39:53.917 --> 39:57.042
a murderer,
is allowed to roam the streets,

39:58.167 --> 40:01.875
and a veteran of the NYPD lies dead.

40:17.250 --> 40:20.167
<i>These vigilantes are a threat</i>

40:20.250 --> 40:25.625
<i>to any society
that's based on the rule of law.</i>

40:29.333 --> 40:33.167
<i>A man who wears a mask
to cover his face...</i>

40:35.500 --> 40:36.667
<i>is a coward.</i>

40:41.250 --> 40:43.958
These vigilantes, they are not heroes.

40:52.292 --> 40:53.875
And I ran on a promise,

40:55.250 --> 40:59.875
<i>and the acquittal of Hector Ayala
demands that I keep it.</i>

41:09.417 --> 41:11.042
The rule of law must prevail.
