00:01.000 --> 00:02.624
How old do you think this desk is?

00:02.625 --> 00:03.916
- Excuse me?
- You wonder.

00:03.917 --> 00:06.332
Did Fiorello La Guardia sit here?

00:06.333 --> 00:07.666
He built this city.

00:10.750 --> 00:13.332
Foggy!

00:13.333 --> 00:17.292
I was told you tried to kill
Benjamin Poindexter that night.

00:18.917 --> 00:21.582
It's hard to come to terms
with a violent nature.

00:21.583 --> 00:23.666
Hating the power that it has over us.

00:23.667 --> 00:24.957
And where is Adam now?

00:24.958 --> 00:27.291
Let me out!

00:27.292 --> 00:30.291
You're asking
New York's elite for money.

00:30.292 --> 00:32.833
Sure, they want influence,
but they don't need it.

00:33.500 --> 00:35.957
I'm mayor of this town.

00:35.958 --> 00:40.332
I will not tolerate people
running around in silly costumes.

00:40.333 --> 00:42.958
The rule of law will prevail.

00:43.792 --> 00:45.291
My name is Muse.

01:09.792 --> 01:15.958
♪ What I say a true part of a lie ♪

01:19.417 --> 01:25.292
♪ Now it's time for us to say goodbye ♪

01:26.250 --> 01:33.874
♪ Right here, right now ♪

02:11.458 --> 02:12.457
Out.

02:14.208 --> 02:15.707
Usually we collect their stuff

02:15.708 --> 02:17.832
but they don't let this fucker
keep anything,

02:17.833 --> 02:22.250
so looks like we're traveling light today.
Hands out.

02:28.042 --> 02:29.042
Move.

02:31.792 --> 02:33.041
Where are we going?

02:36.083 --> 02:37.750
You know I'm ESH, right?

02:38.250 --> 02:39.666
- Until my appeal...
- We know.

02:39.667 --> 02:43.082
Enhanced supervision. All these new terms.

02:43.083 --> 02:45.957
We used to just call it cops,
snitches, and psychos.

02:45.958 --> 02:47.917
Which one are you, Poindexter?

02:49.083 --> 02:50.666
I'm not supposed to be here.

02:50.667 --> 02:52.958
Right. Hear that all the time.

02:53.917 --> 02:54.917
Stop at the line.

02:57.292 --> 02:58.582
What is this?

02:58.583 --> 03:00.416
Welcome to your new digs.

03:00.417 --> 03:03.125
I was told... I'm supposed to be...

03:06.458 --> 03:09.332
Welcome to gen pop,
Agent Poindexter.

04:58.167 --> 04:59.374
I wanted you to know that

04:59.375 --> 05:02.041
the funding for my Red Hook project,
it's happening.

05:02.042 --> 05:03.666
Both public and private.

05:03.667 --> 05:06.042
Congratulations.
You deserve to be happy.

05:07.250 --> 05:12.124
I know that I haven't probably
acknowledged all that you've done,

05:12.125 --> 05:15.083
you know, all that you've built for us,
I know that.

05:19.167 --> 05:22.041
That's why it's so hard to understand
why you'd throw it all away.

05:22.042 --> 05:25.333
Oh, transform. Not throw it away.

05:26.583 --> 05:28.958
What this project here is about to become

05:29.958 --> 05:33.250
is due to what you've done with
our financing. What you did with Luca.

05:34.875 --> 05:37.250
He was a punk, playing at a throne.

05:38.083 --> 05:39.458
It was painful to watch.

05:40.458 --> 05:42.125
That's not why I brought you here.

05:43.292 --> 05:44.917
I brought you here for something else.

05:45.625 --> 05:47.125
Come with me.

06:01.125 --> 06:04.499
Hey, so, um, Madison called
an all-hands meeting at the office.

06:04.500 --> 06:05.832
I should be back for dinner.

06:11.292 --> 06:12.292
I killed him, Matt.

06:13.208 --> 06:16.333
Do you have any idea
what that felt like?

06:17.417 --> 06:18.833
Yeah. I ca... I can only imagine.

06:20.167 --> 06:23.374
Uh, I, I think I'm finally starting
to understand how that violence,

06:23.375 --> 06:27.249
it just transfers
from Daredevil to Muse, to me.

06:27.250 --> 06:29.541
Not sure you can put Muse and Daredevil
in the same category...

06:29.542 --> 06:31.374
Not so sure that you can't.

06:31.375 --> 06:34.332
They're just these underdeveloped boys,

06:34.333 --> 06:37.749
hiding behind masks, trying to make it
look like something more sophisticated.

06:37.750 --> 06:40.707
It's a pretty dark view. I mean, I think
they're completely different animals.

06:40.708 --> 06:43.082
- You weren't there, Matt.
- No, I know. I'm just saying that...

06:43.083 --> 06:45.707
that Muse tried to kill you
and Daredevil saved you.

06:45.708 --> 06:49.542
I saved me.
They were both out there for themselves.

06:52.667 --> 06:53.999
You want me to get that?

06:54.000 --> 06:55.124
No, I'll get it.

07:03.208 --> 07:06.000
Morning, Mr. Murdock. Is Dr. Glenn here?

07:29.208 --> 07:30.583
Vanessa.

07:32.000 --> 07:34.791
This is so fucking crazy.

07:34.792 --> 07:37.332
Please tell your husband I... I'm sorry.
I didn't know...

07:37.333 --> 07:38.458
Stop talking.

07:39.917 --> 07:43.749
I promised you I... I wouldn't kill him.
I kept my promise.

07:43.750 --> 07:47.166
I shouldn't be here. I didn't know!

07:50.292 --> 07:51.708
He's not part of us.

07:53.000 --> 07:54.958
She's right.

07:55.667 --> 07:57.791
You, both of you, please.

07:57.792 --> 08:00.666
I swear to God, I swear to God...

08:00.667 --> 08:03.958
Shut up! I can't.

08:05.250 --> 08:06.250
I'm sorry.

08:07.833 --> 08:12.167
I hear his voice, I... I see his hands.
It's unbearable.

08:13.917 --> 08:17.375
Mr. Cashman, what are you doing here?

08:18.375 --> 08:21.208
The mayor wanted me
to deliver this to you personally.

08:22.333 --> 08:25.374
Along with his deepest admiration
for your strength and courage

08:25.375 --> 08:27.208
in facing that madman, Muse.

08:28.750 --> 08:30.957
"She is a municipal treasure,"
were his exact words...

08:30.958 --> 08:34.625
Hold on a second. How did you
or Mayor Fisk know she was staying here?

08:35.292 --> 08:37.666
The mayor cares deeply about this city
and its citizens.

08:39.458 --> 08:42.583
Have a good day, Counselor.

08:48.167 --> 08:51.416
Heather, how do you know that man?

08:51.417 --> 08:53.374
Why would you keep
all this from me?

08:53.375 --> 08:56.208
I...

08:57.500 --> 09:01.500
I am better than I was. I am.

09:02.833 --> 09:03.833
I am.

09:05.083 --> 09:09.875
And... And if I cannot
be with you, Vanessa,

09:11.750 --> 09:13.542
I cannot be.

09:16.458 --> 09:20.125
Please. Please.

09:21.625 --> 09:23.542
Just let me go.

09:24.708 --> 09:26.624
Heather, I'm serious.
How do you know him?

09:26.625 --> 09:29.583
- You want to watch your tone?
- Please just tell me.

09:31.458 --> 09:32.749
I can't say. It's a work thing.

09:32.750 --> 09:34.332
Please don't tell me Fisk is a client.

09:34.333 --> 09:35.582
I'm not gonna answer that, Matt.

09:35.583 --> 09:37.291
No, you... you don't understand, all right?

09:37.292 --> 09:40.207
If he's in your life, he's in our life.

09:40.208 --> 09:41.374
And that is not good.

09:41.375 --> 09:44.291
He's the mayor. He's in everybody's life.

09:44.292 --> 09:48.208
Please. Please. Vanessa,

09:49.958 --> 09:51.458
I won't say anything.

09:53.000 --> 09:54.792
I'll just leave.

09:58.542 --> 10:00.875
I didn't mean for any of this to happen.

10:03.417 --> 10:04.832
No, you didn't.

10:04.833 --> 10:08.332
"Mayor Fisk and the First Lady
cordially request your presence

10:08.333 --> 10:10.332
"at the Inaugural Black and White Ball

10:10.333 --> 10:13.624
"benefitting the Red Hook
Port Revitalization Project."

10:13.625 --> 10:15.749
Wow. Black tie.

10:15.750 --> 10:17.874
You're not seriously
considering going, are you?

10:17.875 --> 10:20.249
I mean, why wouldn't I?

10:20.250 --> 10:22.041
'Cause he's trying to co-opt your story.

10:22.042 --> 10:24.374
He wants to use your trauma
to boost his narrative.

10:24.375 --> 10:27.999
If his narrative is that vigilantes
are dangerous, then he's got my vote...

10:28.000 --> 10:29.832
Heather, you must see
he's trying to use you.

10:34.625 --> 10:36.957
- I'm sorry.
- Vanessa...

10:36.958 --> 10:39.583
- Please...
- Why don't you come with me?

10:41.333 --> 10:43.291
Protect me from being co-opted.

10:43.292 --> 10:46.333
Yeah,
I don't think that's a good idea.

10:46.958 --> 10:48.999
Besides, I wasn't invited.

10:49.000 --> 10:50.292
Vanessa...

10:51.167 --> 10:53.042
"To Dr. Heather Glenn...

10:54.708 --> 10:55.708
"and guest."

10:59.083 --> 11:01.332
Yeah, okay. Great.

11:01.333 --> 11:03.082
Please. Vanessa...

11:31.167 --> 11:34.207
I...

11:34.208 --> 11:36.583
I promise I won't ever leave you again.

11:37.458 --> 11:38.458
I know.

11:59.625 --> 12:00.625
Yeah.

12:01.458 --> 12:03.250
Okay. Thanks for letting me know.

12:04.542 --> 12:06.749
- You're late.
- Fashionably.

12:06.750 --> 12:09.749
Ten minutes is fashionable.
35 is just not cool.

12:09.750 --> 12:11.874
- I'm here. What's going on?
- Thanks so much.

12:11.875 --> 12:14.374
Oh, you're good?

12:14.375 --> 12:17.332
You look like you just got out
of some North Jersey fight club.

12:17.333 --> 12:19.083
- Thank you, Kirsten.
- Uh-huh.

12:19.958 --> 12:22.000
I'm good. Why is Madison
calling a panic meeting?

12:22.625 --> 12:26.291
Cready, Glaughlin, and McKagan
are stonewalling on the financials.

12:26.292 --> 12:28.207
As in corporate documents
that belong to our client?

12:28.208 --> 12:29.291
- Mmm-hmm.
- Okay.

12:29.292 --> 12:33.249
They are saying that all appeal filings
are as much their purview as the client's

12:33.250 --> 12:34.999
- and since we're engaged in litigation...
- No...

12:35.000 --> 12:37.249
they're under no legal obligation

12:37.250 --> 12:39.624
- to furnish them.
- That doesn't sound like the position

12:39.625 --> 12:41.105
- of an innocent party, does it?
- No.

12:42.792 --> 12:46.666
Seems your poison counsel approach
might actually have some legs.

12:46.667 --> 12:48.041
Is he here?

12:48.042 --> 12:50.542
Yeah, hold on. Just... um...

12:52.000 --> 12:53.250
there's something else.

12:56.125 --> 12:57.375
Poindexter.

12:58.833 --> 13:00.749
- What? What about him?
- I just got a call

13:00.750 --> 13:03.582
from one of my former colleagues
at the Southern District.

13:03.583 --> 13:08.249
He was moved from protective custody
two days ago and released into gen pop.

13:08.250 --> 13:10.332
Great. Any chance
we can get a front row seat?

13:11.833 --> 13:15.417
The reason my friend called
is that Poindexter wants to talk...

13:16.208 --> 13:17.707
- with you.
- With me?

13:17.708 --> 13:18.832
- Yeah.
- Why?

13:18.833 --> 13:19.917
I...

13:20.875 --> 13:24.291
I have no idea. And I don't care.
Neither should you.

13:24.292 --> 13:25.708
Kirsten. Kirsten.

13:27.375 --> 13:28.667
Do we know who moved him?

13:29.458 --> 13:31.707
- I knew you were gonna ask me that.
- Tell me.

13:33.958 --> 13:35.125
Mayor Fisk.

13:36.708 --> 13:37.707
Come on.

13:39.292 --> 13:40.416
Matt, come on.

13:43.625 --> 13:45.874
Sir, as much as
I'm always interested

13:45.875 --> 13:47.999
in an unscheduled meeting with you,

13:48.000 --> 13:50.750
- we are due at our morning press segment...
- Cancel it.

13:51.417 --> 13:55.041
Today is not the day for Public Relations
and kissing dogs in jackets in Brooklyn.

13:55.042 --> 13:56.291
Was that on our schedule?

13:56.292 --> 13:58.416
Today, we take stock
in our victories.

13:58.417 --> 14:00.582
The Task Force is a success.

14:00.583 --> 14:02.541
I'm not sure if you've seen
the latest numbers

14:02.542 --> 14:07.082
but vigilante crime is down 30%
since the Task Force deployed.

14:07.083 --> 14:12.124
And the ACLU is filing 13 different
lawsuits over their excessive methods.

14:12.125 --> 14:15.167
Let them. Excessive methods work.

14:15.750 --> 14:19.207
Not to mention the avalanche
of favorable publicity.

14:19.208 --> 14:21.791
Looks like your conversation with BB Urich

14:21.792 --> 14:24.375
was obviously fruitful, Daniel.

14:24.958 --> 14:26.958
- Doing what I can, sir.
- I know you do.

14:29.750 --> 14:31.125
I think you can do more.

14:33.167 --> 14:34.208
A lot more.

14:35.292 --> 14:38.541
- I'm sorry, sir. I just...
- As Deputy Mayor for Communications.

14:38.542 --> 14:41.917
- No way.
- Excuse me, sir. Him?

14:43.083 --> 14:46.332
Now, work closely with the City Council.

14:46.333 --> 14:49.333
Make sure they turn a listening ear
to our agenda.

14:50.417 --> 14:51.791
Hmm.

14:51.792 --> 14:53.292
Yeah. Of course.

14:53.917 --> 14:58.624
Sir, uh, if I may say so
and I'm so sorry, Daniel,

14:58.625 --> 15:03.041
but I do believe he will be
way in over his head with the Council...

15:03.042 --> 15:04.541
I do mind you saying.

15:07.292 --> 15:10.291
Daniel's the future of this city.
Why would we stand in the way of it?

15:10.292 --> 15:13.875
I swear to Christ, sir,
I will not let you down.

15:14.583 --> 15:18.457
I... I will work night and day for you.
Sir, I will burn for you.

15:18.458 --> 15:21.250
I know you will. I know you will.

15:25.167 --> 15:27.708
Sheila, Vanessa checked.

15:29.542 --> 15:33.750
This is actually
Fiorello La Guardia's desk. Yeah.

15:38.125 --> 15:40.082
I should take the stand.

15:40.083 --> 15:42.082
Mr. Madison, we highly
recommend against it.

15:42.083 --> 15:43.166
I don't know.

15:43.167 --> 15:46.416
You two,
Black lady, blind dude, I like the optics.

15:46.417 --> 15:48.707
I'm just sayin'. I should be seen.

15:48.708 --> 15:51.582
- My voice should be heard.
- And what exactly is that voice saying?

15:51.583 --> 15:53.499
That I had no clue, man.
None at all.

15:53.500 --> 15:55.457
No idea those funds were being commingled.

15:55.458 --> 15:57.416
This whole thing
is not my fault.

16:02.125 --> 16:03.124
Say that again.

16:05.083 --> 16:07.249
- Is he serious?
- Oh, I'm serious.

16:13.833 --> 16:15.166
My mother was a teacher.

16:15.167 --> 16:17.916
My grandmother was a teacher.
My girlfriend's a teacher.

16:17.917 --> 16:19.791
I love teachers.

16:19.792 --> 16:21.541
There's no way that I would
knowingly defraud...

16:21.542 --> 16:22.707
- Bullshit.
- Matt.

16:22.708 --> 16:25.541
Mr. Madison, you do whatever the hell
you want to in this world, all right?

16:25.542 --> 16:27.124
You go with grace, you find your way.

16:27.125 --> 16:29.166
I'm not here to judge you.
I'm here to defend you.

16:29.167 --> 16:32.374
And we at Murdock and McDuffie, we have
a lot of approaches to that defense

16:32.375 --> 16:35.166
but one thing we do not do
is subornation of perjury.

16:35.167 --> 16:37.082
So many words.
I don't know what you're saying.

16:37.083 --> 16:40.166
It means it is against the law
for my partner and I

16:40.167 --> 16:42.749
to put a client on the stand
when we know they're lying.

16:42.750 --> 16:44.166
And...

16:44.167 --> 16:47.208
you, my friend, are lying
with every breath you take.

16:48.542 --> 16:51.083
Why don't you let us know
when you wanna make a plea deal?

16:52.500 --> 16:53.666
Hey!

16:53.667 --> 16:55.707
Hey. Hey.

16:55.708 --> 16:57.791
I told you taking him as a client
was a bad idea.

16:57.792 --> 17:00.249
Yes, but we took him
so we owe him a defense.

17:00.250 --> 17:03.124
- What is going on with you?
- Call it an attack of conscience.

17:03.125 --> 17:05.207
- That was fucking malpractice.
- All right, fine, Kirsten,

17:05.208 --> 17:07.166
you want me to go back in there
and apologize to him?

17:07.167 --> 17:10.582
No, I don't. I wanna know what's going on.
Is it the Poindexter thing?

17:10.583 --> 17:12.374
Should I not have told you about that?

17:12.375 --> 17:14.957
You're late to meetings,
you are insulting our client...

17:14.958 --> 17:18.208
Jesus, Matt, I mean,
I barely recognize you. What is going on?

17:21.292 --> 17:22.500
- Matt.
- Uh...

17:23.375 --> 17:25.082
You know, we...

17:25.083 --> 17:28.082
we put Poindexter away
and it changes nothing, all right?

17:28.083 --> 17:30.499
We defend Hector Ayala
and he's still murdered,

17:30.500 --> 17:34.332
probably by the same cops who are
out there assaulting citizens, by the way,

17:34.333 --> 17:39.124
all right? Leroy Bradford goes away
for eating a box of caramel corn.

17:39.125 --> 17:41.416
Heather's assaulted by Muse
and she thinks Fisk is right.

17:41.417 --> 17:43.249
And now this asshole,
this privileged sociopath...

17:43.250 --> 17:44.416
- Shh.
- Can get away with

17:44.417 --> 17:46.666
ripping off teachers.

17:46.667 --> 17:51.457
We're not serving justice here, you know?
We're babysitting chaos.

17:51.458 --> 17:54.958
This, us, what... what we do,
it feels useless.

17:57.708 --> 18:00.208
I get it. I really get it.

18:02.042 --> 18:04.458
It's all a lot. You... You...

18:06.083 --> 18:09.124
You've been through a lot.
But this can't happen like this.

18:09.125 --> 18:11.833
I know, I'm sorry. I-I have to go.

18:15.000 --> 18:17.541
Jesus. Fuck.

18:31.125 --> 18:33.874
You just gonna stand out there
like a hobo, Matt,

18:33.875 --> 18:35.708
or you gonna come in? Have a drink.

18:44.125 --> 18:46.208
You're good
for the old eyes, Matt.

18:47.208 --> 18:48.875
Haven't seen you since...

18:49.667 --> 18:52.124
- The funeral.
- Yeah.

18:52.125 --> 18:55.542
May you always remember
to forget the things that make you sad

18:56.500 --> 18:59.874
but never forget to remember
the things that make you glad.

18:59.875 --> 19:01.583
Cheers.

19:04.458 --> 19:06.708
I guess, it's a good thing
I can't see the place.

19:07.583 --> 19:09.667
I've been thinking
about reopening,

19:10.333 --> 19:13.625
but I'm not sure
if the neighborhood even wants it.

19:14.667 --> 19:17.291
The mayor's office has offered loans

19:17.292 --> 19:19.666
but I'll be damned
if I take a penny from that man.

19:22.792 --> 19:25.541
Cherry. How'd you track me down?

19:25.542 --> 19:26.667
Kirsten called.

19:27.542 --> 19:29.291
She asked me to keep tabs on you.

19:29.292 --> 19:31.132
- And I'm worried about you too.
- Hmm.

19:32.250 --> 19:34.750
- He's all yours, Cherry.
- Lucky me.

19:37.833 --> 19:39.541
Talk to me, Matt. What's going on?

19:39.542 --> 19:41.707
Well, I guess you could say
the genie's out of the bottle.

19:43.875 --> 19:45.833
Well, your timing is a little off.

19:46.625 --> 19:49.625
Fisk is making a name
for himself hunting vigilantes.

19:50.333 --> 19:52.207
Imagine he'd love to get
your head on a spike.

19:52.208 --> 19:53.292
Among others.

19:53.917 --> 19:56.416
You know he moved Poindexter
into general population.

19:56.417 --> 19:59.083
Huh.
Now that's a death sentence.

20:02.792 --> 20:04.208
We missed something, Cherry.

20:04.958 --> 20:07.791
Fisk, Poindexter, it's all connected.
It has to be.

20:07.792 --> 20:10.167
Matt, we have been through this.

20:10.792 --> 20:14.582
We dug. The DA dug. You have to accept it.

20:14.583 --> 20:16.957
Poindexter was just trying
to settle an old score...

20:16.958 --> 20:19.832
- No.
- No, with Foggy, and Karen, and you.

20:19.833 --> 20:22.207
Cherry, I'm telling you
there's more to it than that.

20:22.208 --> 20:24.125
- I know it.
- You know, from where I sit,

20:24.833 --> 20:27.082
you look like a guy
who's blowing up his life.

20:27.083 --> 20:28.791
Yeah, you might be right.

20:28.792 --> 20:31.000
What do you need, Matt?
You need more pain?

20:32.208 --> 20:33.917
Since we're all here,

20:35.167 --> 20:37.542
we may as well make it official.

20:38.500 --> 20:41.957
- Nah. None for me, thanks. I quit.
- Oh.

20:41.958 --> 20:44.416
- Good on you.
- What'd you mean, "make it official?"

20:44.417 --> 20:47.000
O'Melveny's. Foggy...

20:48.583 --> 20:51.999
never finished his final round.

20:52.000 --> 20:54.542
- Yeah, but he wasn't drinking O'Melveny's.
- Yeah.

20:55.417 --> 20:58.333
Fitting, 'cause he was
the last customer to order.

20:59.583 --> 21:02.207
No. No, Josie, I think...
I think you're wrong about that.

21:02.208 --> 21:04.916
How many oceans of Irish
do you think I serve here?

21:04.917 --> 21:06.708
I know what my people drink.

21:19.000 --> 21:20.875
He was celebrating early.

21:22.333 --> 21:24.499
He knew, Foggy knew.

21:24.500 --> 21:27.707
The night he died, he knew he was
gonna win. His case with Dumb Benny.

21:27.708 --> 21:30.416
Matt, I am really trying
to understand you here, man.

21:30.417 --> 21:33.208
Christ, he knew he was gonna win
and somebody silenced him.

21:36.292 --> 21:37.292
I gotta go.

21:40.083 --> 21:41.833
He didn't use his cane.

21:43.250 --> 21:44.624
I didn't notice.

21:57.750 --> 21:59.374
You know
the precautions, Counselor?

21:59.375 --> 22:01.207
- I do.
- Emergency call button's

22:01.208 --> 22:02.707
- under the table.
- Thanks.

22:14.042 --> 22:15.542
I didn't think you'd show.

22:17.167 --> 22:19.082
- I respect that...
- You shut your mouth.

22:19.083 --> 22:20.707
I don't want your respect.

22:20.708 --> 22:22.041
Why does Fisk want you dead?

22:22.042 --> 22:24.541
Did he hire you to kill Foggy Nelson?

22:28.417 --> 22:29.667
You hear that?

22:31.500 --> 22:32.583
Outside.

22:35.542 --> 22:38.292
That is the roar of the jungle, Counselor.

22:43.000 --> 22:44.333
Is that what I am to you?

22:46.000 --> 22:47.000
An animal?

22:48.375 --> 22:49.375
One of them?

22:51.667 --> 22:53.625
'Cause that's what
this is all about, right?

22:54.833 --> 22:58.125
Who is the predator and who is the prey?

23:00.333 --> 23:01.958
Well, I have questions too.

23:04.708 --> 23:07.667
Everyone thought you were just a shooter
on a rampage, didn't they?

23:08.375 --> 23:10.666
Yeah? Settling scores, getting vengeance.

23:10.667 --> 23:11.999
But it wasn't, was it?

23:13.667 --> 23:15.458
You did it for someone. Huh?

23:17.000 --> 23:19.208
You did it for Fisk. Didn't you?

23:20.417 --> 23:23.041
Another night in here, I might never
be able to answer that for you.

23:23.042 --> 23:25.249
Oh, sweetheart, what do you...
What would you want me to do?

23:25.250 --> 23:27.542
Want me to get you out?
Want me to file an appeal?

23:30.250 --> 23:31.667
You know, in another life,

23:32.833 --> 23:34.292
you might be defending me.

23:38.708 --> 23:40.958
'Cause that's what good men do, right?

23:42.250 --> 23:43.833
Defend their worst enemies.

23:50.792 --> 23:53.083
I'm bargaining
for my life here, Counselor.

23:56.208 --> 23:58.792
You want to know if Fisk hired me?

23:59.417 --> 24:02.125
I can tell you...

24:03.458 --> 24:06.875
- but I need to be outside.
- I don't trust you for a second.

24:08.375 --> 24:09.416
I'm not lying.

24:13.958 --> 24:16.832
Hey, guard!

24:16.833 --> 24:18.582
He started smashing his face
against the table.

24:18.583 --> 24:20.303
You crazy asshole.

24:23.625 --> 24:24.874
Thank you, Counselor.

24:24.875 --> 24:25.957
Fuck you!

24:25.958 --> 24:27.125
Bye.

I'm tryna up my game, you know.

25:13.542 --> 25:15.583
Daniel, I want you to know,

25:16.833 --> 25:20.208
it's not that I'm against you
making Deputy Mayor,

25:20.792 --> 25:22.583
I just think it's premature.

25:24.833 --> 25:26.708
You know when I first started, I was...

25:27.333 --> 25:29.791
I don't know,
I was really worried about us

25:29.792 --> 25:32.249
and whether we were gonna be
on the same side or not.

25:32.250 --> 25:33.375
Mmm-hmm.

25:34.583 --> 25:35.750
I gotta say,

25:36.667 --> 25:38.458
I'm not worried so much anymore.

25:40.125 --> 25:41.666
I gotta go talk to someone.

25:53.167 --> 25:54.167
Hey.

25:55.208 --> 25:56.208
Hey.

25:57.750 --> 25:59.499
You know we're not exactly cool right now.

25:59.500 --> 26:02.000
I pushed pretty hard
on the Task Force thing.

26:04.375 --> 26:05.375
All right, too hard.

26:06.708 --> 26:07.917
But it's the gig...

26:08.750 --> 26:13.125
and it got me
Deputy Mayor of Communications.

26:14.125 --> 26:15.833
- Holy shit.
- Yeah.

26:17.583 --> 26:19.166
Look, BB,

26:20.375 --> 26:24.083
I-I don't know why,
and I don't know how,

26:24.833 --> 26:28.750
but somehow,
I am on the inside of this thing,

26:29.833 --> 26:34.042
and as long as I'm in,
I'm gonna run like hell until...

26:34.833 --> 26:37.083
I don't know,
until somebody tells me to stop.

26:38.500 --> 26:41.042
I mean, look at us.

26:41.958 --> 26:44.167
How... How dope is this place?

26:45.417 --> 26:49.000
I don't know, I've never been
anywhere like here before.

26:50.750 --> 26:51.750
Me either.

26:53.750 --> 26:54.749
Shots?

26:54.750 --> 26:58.332
Oh, hell yeah!

26:58.333 --> 26:59.832
- Artemis!
- Jack!

26:59.833 --> 27:02.957
- So good to see you.
- Hello! Did you come alone?

27:02.958 --> 27:05.374
I did. Always the stag.

27:05.375 --> 27:08.041
I must say,
I am surprised to see you here,

27:08.042 --> 27:10.791
given your feelings towards our mayor.

27:10.792 --> 27:13.708
I thought it best not to offend him.

27:14.792 --> 27:18.249
And where is your better half,
Arthur, tonight?

27:18.250 --> 27:20.917
I... uh... I don't know.

27:21.917 --> 27:22.917
Do you?

27:23.708 --> 27:27.082
Excuse me?
Artemis, is everything all right?

27:27.083 --> 27:30.832
Oh! Yes, yes. Never mind me.

27:30.833 --> 27:32.833
Uh... I'm sorry, I have to go.

27:39.583 --> 27:41.749
...you're trying
to reach is not available.

27:41.750 --> 27:43.999
At the tone, please record your message.

27:44.000 --> 27:46.250
Hey, it's me again.

27:47.750 --> 27:50.458
If you weren't gonna come, I get it but...

27:51.833 --> 27:53.958
you could've at least given me a heads up.

27:57.500 --> 28:00.166
Ladies and gentleman,
esteemed New Yorkers,

28:00.167 --> 28:02.082
welcome to the Black and White Ball.

28:03.583 --> 28:06.249
May I present your hosts,
Mayor Wilson Fisk

28:06.250 --> 28:09.457
and the First Lady of New York,
Vanessa Fisk.

28:36.958 --> 28:39.082
One more loop and stitch,

28:39.083 --> 28:40.707
and that should do it.

28:42.125 --> 28:43.208
He's done.

28:44.833 --> 28:47.583
Stitches should come off in a week
if you don't disturb 'em.

28:48.458 --> 28:50.083
All right.

28:53.458 --> 28:55.538
All right, let's get you back to...

29:04.458 --> 29:07.125
Goddamn!

29:08.167 --> 29:09.249
Motherfu...

29:09.250 --> 29:10.832
Please!

29:36.167 --> 29:37.208
Dr. Glenn.

29:37.958 --> 29:39.250
Mrs. Fisk.

29:39.875 --> 29:42.208
How're you feeling? I'm...
I'm so glad you came.

29:42.958 --> 29:44.000
Thank you.

29:44.750 --> 29:47.499
I'm good. It's nice to get out.

29:47.500 --> 29:51.999
- Uh-huh.
- This is, uh... incredible.

29:52.000 --> 29:53.708
Rich people posturing.

29:54.500 --> 29:55.832
Champagne's good, though.

29:55.833 --> 29:57.083
- Yeah.
- Cheers.

29:58.833 --> 29:59.833
It is.

30:00.583 --> 30:01.707
Are you alone?

30:01.708 --> 30:04.417
Well, I wasn't supposed to be.

30:06.042 --> 30:08.332
Then we can fix that, in a heartbeat...

30:08.333 --> 30:10.542
And it sounds like we should. Come.

30:43.292 --> 30:44.708
Rough day, huh?

30:53.583 --> 30:55.291
I, uh... I wanted to thank you

30:55.292 --> 30:59.082
for how much you've helped
my husband and I.

31:00.625 --> 31:02.625
I look forward to continuing our work.

31:03.333 --> 31:04.417
Yes, well...

31:07.333 --> 31:09.375
I think we've worked it out.

31:11.292 --> 31:15.375
Sins of the past are dead and buried
for both of us.

31:16.375 --> 31:18.417
I'm glad to hear it.

31:19.583 --> 31:21.208
Well, enjoy the evening.

31:22.667 --> 31:23.667
You too.

31:48.500 --> 31:50.540
- Oh, sorry, forgive me.
- Ah, I'm so sorry.

31:51.083 --> 31:52.166
Excuse me.

31:52.167 --> 31:55.042
- This was a pleasure.
- Thank you. Have a good night.

31:56.333 --> 31:58.053
- Sorry. Forgive me.
- Sorry.

31:59.667 --> 32:00.958
Sorry. I'm so sorry.

32:01.500 --> 32:02.917
It's a... It's a pleasure.

32:12.042 --> 32:13.042
Matt.

32:16.917 --> 32:18.041
Hey.

32:18.042 --> 32:21.416
Ah... turns out you're not the only one
wearing Chanel No. 5.

32:21.417 --> 32:23.542
Hello.

32:24.375 --> 32:25.417
Am I... Am I late?

32:26.042 --> 32:28.749
Late? I didn't even know you were coming.

32:28.750 --> 32:31.082
I texted, called, more than once,
by the way.

32:31.083 --> 32:33.249
Yeah, I had to...
I had to surrender my phone.

32:33.250 --> 32:36.250
Oh, I went to Rikers.
Ben Poindexter wanted to meet me.

32:37.792 --> 32:39.666
- What were you thinking, Matt? Him?
- I know.

32:39.667 --> 32:41.666
- Yeah. It's hard to...
- You know what?

32:41.667 --> 32:44.332
I don't care. It's fine.
It's none of my business.

32:44.333 --> 32:46.249
I'm sorry. I apologize.
Heather, I'm sorry...

32:46.250 --> 32:49.957
Matt, you have been checking out on me,

32:49.958 --> 32:53.250
disappearing physically and emotionally.

32:53.833 --> 32:56.874
Mr. Mayor, thank you so much
for the invitation.

32:56.875 --> 32:58.375
Ah, it's my pleasure.

32:59.375 --> 33:02.124
Would you like to talk in private?

33:02.125 --> 33:03.666
- Of course.
- Oh, my God,

33:03.667 --> 33:06.041
- you're not even listening to me, are you?
- I'm...

33:06.042 --> 33:07.125
Yes, I am.

33:08.375 --> 33:09.624
- I...
- What did I say?

33:09.625 --> 33:11.833
I'm glad we get a chance to talk.

33:12.417 --> 33:14.832
I think we may have gotten off
on the wrong foot

33:14.833 --> 33:16.582
at the fundraiser a while ago.

33:16.583 --> 33:17.875
What foot is that?

33:18.917 --> 33:21.708
Well, I think
I underestimated your...

33:22.500 --> 33:27.167
tenacity in pushing
that Red Hook project through.

33:28.125 --> 33:29.208
"Underestimated"?

33:30.208 --> 33:31.667
That's one way of putting it.

33:32.250 --> 33:35.875
Some might say snide, or condescending...

33:36.667 --> 33:38.541
even rude.

33:39.667 --> 33:41.874
Well, I do apologize.

33:41.875 --> 33:43.208
Nothing to be sorry for.

33:43.833 --> 33:47.083
As a matter of fact, the port project
is why I wanted to speak with you.

33:47.708 --> 33:48.957
Please, I'm all ears.

33:48.958 --> 33:51.707
Well, as you may or may not know,

33:51.708 --> 33:55.042
key to the project
is matching public funds

33:56.292 --> 33:59.832
with private investors.
How much can I count on you for?

33:59.833 --> 34:02.207
Excuse me?

34:02.208 --> 34:03.999
I have no interest right now...

34:04.000 --> 34:07.333
Before you continue
and embarrass either of us...

34:10.625 --> 34:12.292
You are aware of your...

34:13.542 --> 34:15.500
well, of the rumors that surround you?

34:16.167 --> 34:20.291
Shall I call you Swordsman, the vigilante?

34:31.750 --> 34:34.708
Even if I knew
what you were talking about,

34:36.208 --> 34:38.499
that sort of thing
would be an isolated incident.

34:38.500 --> 34:39.583
Hmm.

34:40.292 --> 34:43.874
Yet still probable cause
for a visit from my Task Force.

34:43.875 --> 34:45.500
Is that a threat?

34:46.208 --> 34:47.375
No, of course not.

34:48.583 --> 34:50.292
It's merely a warning.

34:53.958 --> 34:58.250
I'll have my office
contact your CFO in the morning.

35:01.667 --> 35:04.292
- Enjoy the rest of your evening.
- Hmm.

35:10.583 --> 35:11.917
Powell, take care of him.

35:13.917 --> 35:14.917
Thank you.

35:27.625 --> 35:29.083
Hey!

35:29.792 --> 35:31.249
What's this? What's this?

35:31.250 --> 35:33.749
There's no pictures inside,
but you knew that, right?

35:35.708 --> 35:38.917
What's that?
No fuckin' acting press inside either.

35:39.708 --> 35:41.624
Look, I know my rights.

35:41.625 --> 35:43.957
Oh, yeah? Very good, me too.
Let me read them to you.

35:47.167 --> 35:50.207
You have the right to have
a real hard time wipin' your ass

35:50.208 --> 35:51.957
- for the rest of your life.
- No! No!

35:51.958 --> 35:53.292
Officer Powell!

35:54.125 --> 35:56.249
You let that man go
or I will charge you with assault.

35:56.250 --> 35:58.500
Commissioner, no, this isn't assault.

36:08.750 --> 36:09.875
That was assault.

36:10.625 --> 36:12.249
And you're not gonna charge me with shit.

36:12.250 --> 36:14.666
In case you haven't noticed,
I don't answer to you anymore.

36:14.667 --> 36:15.874
Listen, what you...

36:18.042 --> 36:21.207
What the Task Force is doing
is dereliction of duty.

36:23.208 --> 36:25.125
Go have a fuckin' canape, Commissioner.

36:25.958 --> 36:29.166
Get him up, come on.
You fuckin' smart-ass piece of shit.

36:33.083 --> 36:34.833
See that? That's power.

36:35.708 --> 36:39.333
There's 500 people in here,
and they all wanna be either in that room

36:39.958 --> 36:42.333
or shittin' their pants
that he's gonna call 'em into it.

36:43.583 --> 36:44.957
Straight up boss power.

36:44.958 --> 36:46.292
Or total corruption.

36:47.125 --> 36:48.999
Why do you do that?

36:49.000 --> 36:50.999
Every time I get stoked, you do that.

36:51.000 --> 36:53.874
My uncle used to say
that we should speak truth to power.

36:53.875 --> 36:56.541
Is that what you're doing?
Is that what we're doing?

36:56.542 --> 36:58.000
I don't know, BB, I...

36:59.417 --> 37:01.082
I'll try to not be an asshole.

37:02.542 --> 37:04.249
Okay. That works for me.

37:07.542 --> 37:10.124
Should we keep gettin' ripped and dance?

37:10.125 --> 37:13.500
Absolutely. I'm gonna hit the ladies room,
and I'll meet you at the bar.

37:19.333 --> 37:20.500
Commissioner Gallo?

37:22.500 --> 37:23.833
I'm BB Urich.

37:25.208 --> 37:26.332
Yeah, I know who you are.

37:26.333 --> 37:28.999
I just wanted to ask you
if the mayor consulted you

37:29.000 --> 37:31.624
when he formed
the Anti-Vigilante Task Force?

37:31.625 --> 37:33.833
You workin' tonight?

37:34.375 --> 37:36.250
I don't know. Are you?

37:39.250 --> 37:43.750
You know, I-I read your piece
on the Muse killing.

37:45.083 --> 37:48.207
That's a hell of a bit of spin,
giving credit to the Task Force

37:48.208 --> 37:50.958
when everyone with half a brain
knows that it was Daredevil.

37:51.500 --> 37:54.708
When did you become
Fisk's minister of propaganda?

37:55.500 --> 37:58.542
Right about the time
you became head of his SS, I figure.

37:59.458 --> 38:04.083
No... No, that's not me.
The Task Force is all him.

38:04.750 --> 38:07.250
How much do you know
about our esteemed mayor?

38:08.833 --> 38:11.875
- I would like to learn a lot more.
- Yeah, don't be so sure.

38:13.875 --> 38:19.083
Do you know that Wilson Fisk was
the main suspect in your uncle's murder?

38:21.542 --> 38:24.792
Yeah. I did.

38:27.708 --> 38:29.792
Why do you think I'm here?

38:31.875 --> 38:34.125
Not everything I write is under my name.

38:37.333 --> 38:38.625
Do you know what I mean?

38:40.458 --> 38:41.624
I think I do.

38:43.833 --> 38:44.917
Um...

38:45.667 --> 38:47.917
So if you ever wanna
put anything real out there,

38:48.583 --> 38:51.375
something that puts a dent
in that prick's white armor...

38:52.708 --> 38:55.042
there's an email on this card.

39:01.125 --> 39:02.417
You know...

39:05.083 --> 39:09.500
I have files on every crook with a badge
that Fisk calls his Task Force.

39:11.750 --> 39:14.332
I would really like to take a look
at those, Commissioner.

39:19.958 --> 39:23.333
Um... If you don't mind,
I have to get back to work.

39:25.542 --> 39:26.542
Shots!

39:30.125 --> 39:32.625
Thank you! Cheers.

39:33.250 --> 39:34.957
I don't know
what's goin' on with you.

39:34.958 --> 39:36.874
I know you've got issues with Mayor Fisk.

39:36.875 --> 39:39.332
- He's your client?
- I'm not gonna tell you that.

39:39.333 --> 39:42.124
I don't expect you to understand,
but I need you to know,

39:42.125 --> 39:44.250
he sought you out to get to me.

39:44.875 --> 39:47.416
- To keep tabs on me.
- Matt, you're starting to worry me

39:47.417 --> 39:49.624
on a professional level.
Why would he do that?

39:49.625 --> 39:52.208
Well, you know what?
Why don't we go find out? Come on.

39:52.875 --> 39:54.167
What're you gonna do?

39:55.208 --> 39:57.666
- Confront the mayor at his own party?
- Maybe.

39:57.667 --> 39:58.791
That's acting out, Matt.

39:58.792 --> 40:01.500
And mental health is knowing
when and where to do it.

40:02.917 --> 40:04.999
Oh, please, don't. Come on.

40:05.000 --> 40:08.666
Thank you, and do not forget your promise.

40:18.333 --> 40:19.375
Please, I'm asking.

40:25.917 --> 40:28.500
Excuse me. Excuse me.

40:32.583 --> 40:35.999
Darling, it's time for us
to take the first dance.

40:36.000 --> 40:37.374

He's not gonna let you, not now.

41:43.792 --> 41:45.499
You're not making any sense.

41:45.500 --> 41:47.457
I told you, Heather. He is a monster.

41:47.458 --> 41:50.458
You're not safe.
No one is safe until this is done,

41:51.125 --> 41:52.832
and I'm not running anymore.

41:52.833 --> 41:55.042
You need to help me understand
what's going on here.

41:56.208 --> 41:59.333
Yeah, and I will, I promise, but first...

42:00.875 --> 42:02.291
You're gonna have to lead.

42:15.458 --> 42:19.042
What were you looking for, Devil?

42:20.250 --> 42:21.374
What's wrong?

42:21.375 --> 42:23.582
Told you there'd be consequences.

42:23.583 --> 42:26.124
If anything happens,
you get out of here, call Kirsten,

42:26.125 --> 42:27.499
call Cherry,

42:27.500 --> 42:30.416
- and make as big a stink as you can.
- About what?

42:32.083 --> 42:33.292
Cashman here.

42:33.875 --> 42:35.000
You wanted updates.

42:37.125 --> 42:38.417
Please just tell me he's dead.

42:39.083 --> 42:40.542
No.

42:41.958 --> 42:42.999
He escaped.

43:27.375 --> 43:30.625
Ben Poindexter killed a prison guard
and used his badge to escape.

43:32.083 --> 43:33.667
I've already informed security.

43:35.125 --> 43:36.250
Thank you, Buck.

43:36.958 --> 43:38.750
Try not to draw too much attention.

43:43.417 --> 43:46.542
I have something to tell you.

43:47.167 --> 43:49.207
No, not here, not now.

43:55.958 --> 43:57.375
- It was her.
- Who?

44:00.292 --> 44:04.333
He was away, and she was in charge.
It was her. She did it.

44:05.000 --> 44:06.167
What are you doing?

44:07.833 --> 44:11.042
Ooh, I'm so sorry.
Mind if I cut in?

44:12.542 --> 44:14.458
What a pleasant surprise.

44:15.625 --> 44:16.917
I know it was you.

44:18.042 --> 44:19.874
I know you had Foggy killed.

44:19.875 --> 44:22.166
Your boyfriend seems a little...

44:22.167 --> 44:24.958
overly exercised this evening.

44:26.125 --> 44:29.832
At first, I was pissed off,
but now, I'm worried.

44:29.833 --> 44:31.208
This isn't like him.

44:32.042 --> 44:35.542
You know, it's been said
that keeping secrets

44:36.375 --> 44:38.000
can make us sick.

45:05.375 --> 45:07.083
You see, I know it was you.

45:07.875 --> 45:09.207
I just don't know why.

45:09.208 --> 45:11.249
I have no idea
what you're talking about.

45:11.250 --> 45:12.417
Yes, you do.

45:13.583 --> 45:15.500
What about your husband? Does he know?

45:16.792 --> 45:18.582
Did he know you had Foggy killed?

45:18.583 --> 45:20.416
Does Heather know you're Daredevil?

45:20.417 --> 45:24.791
Have you ever wondered why Mr. Murdock
has a thing for vigilantes, Doctor?

45:24.792 --> 45:28.207
You will pay for what you did.

45:28.208 --> 45:30.082
You need to relax.
