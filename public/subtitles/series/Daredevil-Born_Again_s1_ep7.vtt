00:10.667 --> 00:15.416
I've been thinking a lot about
projected personas, or... masks.

00:15.417 --> 00:16.707
Dr. Glenn, I need help.

00:16.708 --> 00:18.624
I'm sure we can
work something out.

00:18.625 --> 00:20.250
Thank you.

00:21.750 --> 00:25.166
<i>You know, politics, it's a
different type of problem solving.</i>

00:25.167 --> 00:26.457
<i>Most of it is new to me.</i>

00:26.458 --> 00:30.082
This project simply doesn't
align with our interests.

00:30.083 --> 00:32.832
But some things, they
remain unchanged.

00:32.833 --> 00:33.999
<i>Find what a person wants,</i>

00:34.000 --> 00:35.457
<i>then either withhold it...</i>

00:35.458 --> 00:37.416
Make it 2.8 for Viktor.

00:37.417 --> 00:40.125
Or provide it... and
they'll do anything.

00:41.042 --> 00:42.541
Man's obviously
mocking the police.

00:42.542 --> 00:43.624
<i>We can use this.</i>

00:43.625 --> 00:44.707
A task force.

00:44.708 --> 00:46.249
<i>It's every bad
apple in the barrel.</i>

00:46.250 --> 00:47.832
This is what Hector
would have wanted.

00:47.833 --> 00:51.082
All those kidnappings were
all close to the old track 61.

00:52.250 --> 00:54.749
<i>The rule of law will prevail.</i>

00:54.750 --> 00:58.999
<i>Should you go back to any
of your old activities...</i>

00:59.000 --> 01:01.167
<i>there will be consequences.</i>

01:06.250 --> 01:08.458
When you look outside this
window, what do you see?

01:10.292 --> 01:11.374
- Starbucks?
- Voters.

01:11.375 --> 01:12.458
Voters.

01:15.250 --> 01:16.417
What do you see, sir?

01:18.292 --> 01:22.250
Fear. A city
churning to a stop...

01:24.667 --> 01:26.375
And I promised the
city that I would...

01:27.375 --> 01:30.750
protect them from this... freak,

01:31.542 --> 01:32.832
and we have nothing.

01:32.833 --> 01:34.999
Well, that's not
entirely true, sir.

01:35.000 --> 01:37.416
A girl named Angela Del
Toro was dropped off

01:37.417 --> 01:39.166
at Presbyterian late last night.

01:39.167 --> 01:41.332
Says she actually
escaped from Muse.

01:41.333 --> 01:43.374
- She's still alive?
- She lost a lotta blood,

01:43.375 --> 01:45.666
like, 2,500 milliliters

01:45.667 --> 01:48.249
which, I don't know,
kinda sounds like a lot,

01:48.250 --> 01:51.332
but she was able to point the
cops toward Muse's hideout.

01:51.333 --> 01:52.582
But how did she escape?

01:52.583 --> 01:57.917
The girl claims she was rescued by
the vigilante known as "Daredevil."

02:03.583 --> 02:04.791
So, he's back.

02:04.792 --> 02:07.167
- We don't know that for sure.
- Get out.

02:19.917 --> 02:21.167
He's back.

04:21.500 --> 04:22.500
<i>It's okay.</i>

04:24.375 --> 04:25.667
<i>I'm here.</i>

04:27.583 --> 04:29.708
I'm here.

05:01.250 --> 05:02.250
Matt...

05:45.167 --> 05:46.667
You were gone when I got here.

05:47.458 --> 05:49.916
Madison case. It's a bear.

05:49.917 --> 05:52.374
Matt, you left
your briefcase here

05:52.375 --> 05:54.874
and... you didn't get
those bruises at work.

05:54.875 --> 05:58.167
I went for a walk. I'm having
trouble sleeping. Okay?

05:59.208 --> 06:02.082
Sorry, Heather, I know, I
know you worry about me,

06:02.083 --> 06:04.707
but... I do just occasionally
bump into things.

06:04.708 --> 06:06.457
It is part of my reality.

06:06.458 --> 06:09.457
- Then why lie about going for a walk?
- 'Cause it's embarrassing, sweetie.

06:09.458 --> 06:13.374
No, Matt. What's going on?

06:13.375 --> 06:16.374
You're checked out a
large portion of the time.

06:16.375 --> 06:20.124
You put yourself in dangerous
situations like the bank.

06:20.125 --> 06:23.332
You're beat up. Is this
some sort of self-harm?

06:23.333 --> 06:25.625
No.

06:27.458 --> 06:31.832
Look, I'm just dealing with some
things, and obviously not very well.

06:31.833 --> 06:33.041
Some things?

06:33.042 --> 06:37.292
Look, Heather, you realize I used
to have this whole other life...

06:39.208 --> 06:41.916
and it was a lot...
different to this.

06:41.917 --> 06:45.167
At your old firm,
with your old friends.

06:45.958 --> 06:47.333
Foggy and...

06:48.000 --> 06:49.082
Karen.

06:49.083 --> 06:51.500
Kinda.

06:53.792 --> 06:57.042
You know, and sometimes
this all feels,

06:57.875 --> 07:00.375
to me, feels like...

07:01.708 --> 07:04.666
...fake.

07:10.083 --> 07:11.457
Fake?

07:11.458 --> 07:14.833
- Not you.
- Yeah.

07:17.250 --> 07:18.625
I'm sorry to do this...

07:20.458 --> 07:24.542
but you have been tamping
down trauma for so long...

07:26.500 --> 07:29.332
you can't even see when it's
bubbling up inside of you

07:29.333 --> 07:31.916
and threatens to ruin
everything good you have.

07:31.917 --> 07:33.624
I know. I know.

07:33.625 --> 07:35.292
- Everything good we have.
- Yep.

07:36.208 --> 07:38.167
And I'm trying really
hard to fight it.

07:38.958 --> 07:42.708
It's not a fight.
It's a process.

07:43.458 --> 07:46.291
Got it. Understood. Thank you.

07:46.292 --> 07:47.749
- Dr. Glenn.
- Oh!

07:47.750 --> 07:50.666
- Don't joke your way out of this.
- Okay, okay, I'm sorry.

07:50.667 --> 07:52.417
Hey, I'm sorry.

07:56.708 --> 07:57.750
I love you, Matt.

08:00.542 --> 08:01.750
I love you, too.

08:25.083 --> 08:27.124
- What the hell is wrong with you?
- Morning, Cherry.

08:27.125 --> 08:28.416
You think I wouldn't find out?

08:28.417 --> 08:30.249
You give me your word and
then you pull this shit?

08:30.250 --> 08:32.957
Keep your voice down, please.
Let's talk in the conference room.

08:32.958 --> 08:34.666
Matt, can I just chat
with you for a second...

08:34.667 --> 08:37.916
Just give me two minutes. I just need to
talk to Cherry about the Edelstein case.

08:37.917 --> 08:39.249
- Two minutes.
- Mm-hmm.

08:39.250 --> 08:42.374
- I told you to stay out of it.
- What was I supposed to do?

08:42.375 --> 08:44.166
The cops were dicking
around getting nowhere.

08:44.167 --> 08:45.457
I found Muse in one night.

08:45.458 --> 08:47.249
- You want a medal?
- He's a serial killer.

08:47.250 --> 08:49.041
Cherry, this is different.

08:49.042 --> 08:52.082
Sixty dead. Would've been one
more if Daredevil hadn't shown up,

08:52.083 --> 08:53.624
and he's still out there.

08:53.625 --> 08:56.416
So I need you to reach out to your
contacts and find out exactly where

08:56.417 --> 08:58.082
- all of Muse's victims...
- No, what, so you think

08:58.083 --> 09:00.666
- I'm gonna enable you with this shit?
- After last night,

09:00.667 --> 09:04.624
he's gonna go into survival mode
'cause he knows he's got limited time.

09:04.625 --> 09:08.041
If I can figure out his pattern, I can
figure out where he's gonna strike next.

09:08.042 --> 09:10.166
So, do me a favor, talk
to your contacts...

09:10.167 --> 09:11.624
No. No, no, no, no.

09:11.625 --> 09:15.292
If you wanna blow up your
life again, you go ahead...

09:16.208 --> 09:17.208
but you're on your own.

09:18.708 --> 09:22.832
You know, was a time when
you were on the force,

09:22.833 --> 09:25.708
moments like this,
you called me.

09:37.125 --> 09:41.541
It was just over a year
ago... when he vanished.

09:41.542 --> 09:43.000
But why now?

09:43.792 --> 09:46.541
It's not like Muse is the first
serial killer the city's ever seen.

09:46.542 --> 09:51.292
We're talking about a man who...
dresses in a devil costume.

09:53.375 --> 09:55.750
- I don't know why.
- If he is back,

09:56.792 --> 09:58.417
if he is going after Muse,

10:00.125 --> 10:01.916
it's not the worst thing
in the world, is it?

10:05.208 --> 10:07.917
I just mean... for
the sake of the city.

10:08.500 --> 10:09.999
For the sake of the city.

10:12.083 --> 10:14.666
We're talking about a man
who singlehandedly destroyed

10:14.667 --> 10:16.916
ten years of business
infrastructure.

10:16.917 --> 10:18.624
- You understand what I'm saying?
- Yes, sir.

10:18.625 --> 10:22.167
Ten years I built
that operation.

10:24.167 --> 10:25.833
It was totally fail-proof.

10:27.750 --> 10:30.999
Fail-proof until he had
me unjustly arrested.

10:31.000 --> 10:33.874
He took down my entire business,

10:33.875 --> 10:36.082
one that made
hardworking people,

10:36.083 --> 10:38.499
who believed in themselves
and my enterprise,

10:38.500 --> 10:40.083
richer than they
ever dreamed of!

10:40.667 --> 10:43.916
An entire network of
blue-collar millionaires,

10:43.917 --> 10:49.499
from distributors overseas to
the... to the port workers here.

10:49.500 --> 10:52.250
Those people, they
had... they had grit.

10:54.292 --> 10:57.125
He went on a rampage. He
tracked down all my workers,

10:58.083 --> 11:00.292
custom facilitators,
all of them...

11:08.167 --> 11:09.832
Savagely beating them.

11:09.833 --> 11:13.124
He broke bones. Broke spirits.

11:13.125 --> 11:16.749
Without due process. Without
standing or legal cause.

11:16.750 --> 11:19.167
All because of this
twisted, delusional man.

11:19.917 --> 11:21.000
This vigilante.

11:23.000 --> 11:25.958
Because of his righteousness.

11:28.083 --> 11:32.583
But... you've moved
on from that now, huh?

11:34.000 --> 11:35.250
You're the Mayor now.

11:38.083 --> 11:41.792
Yes, I... I have more resources.

11:42.667 --> 11:46.416
Institutional resources.
Law enforcement resources.

11:46.417 --> 11:50.708
Using those to settle old scores
could be seen as an abuse of power.

11:51.542 --> 11:53.125
When I brought you over...

11:55.167 --> 11:56.792
from your previous life,

11:58.250 --> 12:01.000
can you recall why
I said I hired you?

12:01.667 --> 12:05.791
I believe you called it my ability
to think... asymmetrically.

12:05.792 --> 12:08.624
Yes, Buck, yes.

12:08.625 --> 12:13.332
Now, I have the responsibility
to protect this city

12:13.333 --> 12:16.499
from anyone who steps
outside of the law.

12:34.542 --> 12:36.250
<i>I was right, Mr. Murdock.</i>

12:38.417 --> 12:39.625
<i>Hector was right.</i>

12:40.708 --> 12:43.833
<i>And then Daredevil kicked
the shit out of him.</i>

12:44.708 --> 12:47.417
- Daredevil saved me.
- Yeah, I heard.

12:48.750 --> 12:52.416
Angela, what do you remember? About
Muse? About Track 61? Anything?

12:52.417 --> 12:55.750
Besides the murder basement
and the bloodletting stuff?

12:56.208 --> 12:57.500
<i>Yeah, besides that.</i>

12:59.792 --> 13:06.375
<i>Those... detectives asked me a
bunch of questions when I woke up.</i>

13:21.625 --> 13:22.667
Jesus.

13:24.000 --> 13:25.458
What's the point?

13:26.542 --> 13:28.902
- Cops ain't gonna do nothing about it.
- No. If they don't,

13:30.458 --> 13:33.708
somebody will. I promise you.

13:34.958 --> 13:36.875
Now, I need you to
think really carefully.

13:37.958 --> 13:40.374
What can you tell me that
was out of the ordinary?

13:40.375 --> 13:43.333
What was different? Unique?

13:45.625 --> 13:50.249
<i>He had these, uh...
these sketches</i>

13:50.250 --> 13:54.499
<i>and he was really...
amped about them.</i>

13:54.500 --> 13:58.791
Kept talking about them.
He kept doing them.

13:58.792 --> 14:01.125
What of? Like, uh,
murals? Of people?

14:05.125 --> 14:06.125
Faces.

14:16.958 --> 14:19.292
Thanks for meeting
me, Mrs. Fisk.

14:20.958 --> 14:23.333
You've been causing
a lot of chaos, Luca.

14:24.208 --> 14:26.249
If you're looking for
attention, there are other ways.

14:26.250 --> 14:30.083
Look, I'm a straight
shooter. I don't do politics.

14:32.917 --> 14:36.999
Why the hell does he wanna
be mayor? What's his angle?

14:37.000 --> 14:40.417
I don't have to explain my husband's
actions to you or to anyone.

14:42.625 --> 14:45.416
You think it's bullshit
too, don't you?

14:45.417 --> 14:48.416
We're not earning
like we were with you.

14:48.417 --> 14:49.999
Most of us aren't
earning at all.

14:50.000 --> 14:52.374
Then he sends the Brit to ding
me for nearly two million.

14:52.375 --> 14:53.458
That was me.

14:54.833 --> 14:56.874
- Oh.
- You know the rules.

14:56.875 --> 15:00.417
Play nice. Keep smart. Keep low.

15:01.083 --> 15:03.166
You did none of
that. Now you owe.

15:03.167 --> 15:06.041
The rules were worth it when
you were running things.

15:06.042 --> 15:09.207
It was better then.
You know that.

15:09.208 --> 15:10.917
I can see it on your face.

15:18.000 --> 15:19.417
Maybe...

15:21.708 --> 15:23.208
It's time for a change.

15:24.375 --> 15:28.625
Are you asking for my
permission or... my help?

15:30.125 --> 15:31.250
That's up to you.

15:38.417 --> 15:39.458
Hi.

15:45.542 --> 15:47.250
<i>I've been having this dream.</i>

15:47.958 --> 15:50.791
It's my eighth birthday and
we're at the house Upstate.

15:50.792 --> 15:52.457
We used to spend summers there.

15:52.458 --> 15:56.832
And I go outside and someone hands
me this bouquet of red balloons,

15:56.833 --> 15:58.667
and I don't know why.
No other kid has them.

15:59.958 --> 16:01.875
And then my parents,
they wheel out this...

16:03.000 --> 16:06.166
like, giant birthday cake...

16:06.167 --> 16:09.291
...and they call for me to come over
but when I join them, they don't see me.

16:09.292 --> 16:12.207
I mean, no one knows I'm there.

16:12.208 --> 16:14.833
Um, what do you think it means?

16:15.625 --> 16:17.374
I have no idea.

16:17.375 --> 16:21.208
You said your parents put
a lot of pressure on you.

16:22.625 --> 16:24.042
No, I love my parents.

16:24.958 --> 16:27.541
<i>Bastian Cooper. Who is he?</i>

16:27.542 --> 16:29.292
<i>And are you certain
he's our guy?</i>

16:32.292 --> 16:34.916
Certain, no. Confident, yes.

16:34.917 --> 16:38.582
I, um, found a piece of clothing in
Muse's lair and we assumed it was fabric,

16:38.583 --> 16:41.457
but our analysis showed
that it was actually canvas.

16:41.458 --> 16:42.541
Canvas?

16:42.542 --> 16:45.457
This particular canvas is
very rare, very expensive.

16:45.458 --> 16:47.999
There's only two stores in
the entire city that sell it.

16:48.000 --> 16:50.166
In the last two weeks,
12 people have bought it

16:50.167 --> 16:52.250
and we have talked
to 11 of them.

16:53.167 --> 16:55.332
Bastian is the only
person we couldn't find.

16:55.333 --> 16:56.916
Doesn't prove he's guilty.

16:56.917 --> 17:00.707
No, but when we started
looking into Bastian's past...

17:00.708 --> 17:03.833
...we made some
troubling discoveries.

17:10.083 --> 17:12.583
Involuntary commitment
when he was 15.

17:13.167 --> 17:15.167
<i>Expelled from Phillips Exeter.</i>

17:16.083 --> 17:18.749
<i>Involuntary commitment
when he was 17</i>

17:18.750 --> 17:21.832
and... another one
when he was 20.

17:21.833 --> 17:26.125
- He certainly does have issues.
- There is one more thing, sir, um...

17:27.708 --> 17:29.708
How familiar are
you with taekwondo?

17:30.542 --> 17:31.542
I like boxing.

17:33.542 --> 17:36.082
Did I ever tell you I used
to compete in taekwondo?

17:36.083 --> 17:39.166
No. Did you enjoy it?

17:39.167 --> 17:40.874
No, I hated it.

17:40.875 --> 17:43.791
I mean, my parents, they always
wanted an athlete in the family.

17:43.792 --> 17:48.041
So, you competed in taekwondo...
to prove yourself to them?

17:48.042 --> 17:50.875
No, I competed in taekwondo
because they made me...

17:51.875 --> 17:54.624
and it was awful, but
they wouldn't let me quit.

17:54.625 --> 17:58.749
There are really only a handful
of truly elite taekwondo coaches

17:58.750 --> 18:01.124
and Lee Suk Ji was one of them.

18:01.125 --> 18:04.041
That's why his father hired
Coach Lee to live with them

18:04.042 --> 18:07.542
and coach his son. Bastian
was 16 at the time.

18:08.083 --> 18:09.375
You said was...

18:09.917 --> 18:13.582
Three months after Coach Lee
started training Bastian,

18:13.583 --> 18:15.499
his body showed
up on the estate.

18:15.500 --> 18:20.000
Cause of death was listed as unknown
but there was never an investigation.

18:20.750 --> 18:22.166
And you think
Bastian killed him.

18:22.167 --> 18:25.458
I'll put it this way. It
wouldn't surprise me if he did.

18:26.208 --> 18:31.124
But you know, we're in a innocent-until-
proven-otherwise business so...

18:31.125 --> 18:32.417
You know, I hated him but...

18:36.583 --> 18:39.125
In the end, I learned
a lot from Coach Lee.

18:43.333 --> 18:45.708
Um, do you still
compete in taekwondo?

18:46.333 --> 18:48.125
Uh, God no, um...

18:49.500 --> 18:52.375
I mean, all I ever wanted
to be was an artist.

18:53.333 --> 18:55.583
To be the person I am now and...

18:57.917 --> 18:59.250
That's all thanks to you.

19:00.250 --> 19:02.125
That is kind of
you to say, but...

19:03.208 --> 19:05.375
- I'm just the conduit...
- No, you're the key.

19:08.083 --> 19:09.458
I mean, don't you see that?

19:10.000 --> 19:13.957
I mean, you've unlocked
something in me, Dr. Glenn.

19:13.958 --> 19:15.791
Something I didn't
know was missing.

19:15.792 --> 19:18.582
I mean, you've allowed my
creativity to flourish,

19:18.583 --> 19:22.000
to soar to heights I
never even imagined.

19:25.708 --> 19:28.082
So, um, let's talk
about homework...

19:28.083 --> 19:30.207
No, you're not listening
to me, Dr. Glenn.

19:34.000 --> 19:38.500
This city... is finally starting
to see me for who I really am.

19:40.083 --> 19:42.083
Does that mean you've
been displaying your art?

19:46.833 --> 19:48.291
You could say that.

19:48.292 --> 19:51.916
Is there anything else you
found... in that tunnel?

19:51.917 --> 19:54.082
Uh, I'm sorry, sir?

19:54.083 --> 19:58.000
There's rumors that, uh,
Muse and the victim wasn't...

19:58.958 --> 20:01.499
Well, they weren't the
only ones down there.

20:01.500 --> 20:06.374
Rumors that... the vigilante
from Hell's Kitchen is back.

20:06.375 --> 20:09.124
Well, those, uh,
aren't just rumors.

20:09.125 --> 20:11.249
We don't have
confirmation on that, sir,

20:11.250 --> 20:13.833
but we are definitely
open to the possibility.

20:18.125 --> 20:21.041
Yeah. Uh, thank you.
You've done a good job.

20:21.042 --> 20:22.582
Uh, of course, sir.

20:22.583 --> 20:24.208
And I'll take it from here.

20:27.083 --> 20:28.583
- Thank you, sir.
- Uh-huh.

20:37.792 --> 20:39.000
Bastian, your nose.

20:53.250 --> 20:55.374
Becoming your true
self can be scary.

20:55.375 --> 20:56.792
It's like you always say,

20:57.667 --> 20:59.332
"We can't hide from ourselves.

20:59.333 --> 21:03.917
"It's only when we embrace who
we are, we can truly be free."

21:06.083 --> 21:07.833
Tell me about that drawing.

21:11.125 --> 21:16.000
You already know, Dr. Glenn.
I can see it in your face.

21:18.542 --> 21:20.999
Hey. Oh, no, no,
no, no, no, no, no.

21:21.000 --> 21:23.042
Come on. This is a good thing.

21:23.958 --> 21:26.124
Now there are no more
secrets between us.

21:30.083 --> 21:33.000
Is that...

21:35.833 --> 21:37.083
My true self.

21:38.875 --> 21:39.916
Bastian, please...

21:39.917 --> 21:43.957
I... I know what you're
thinking, Dr. Glenn.

21:43.958 --> 21:46.583
There's only one question
on your mind right now.

21:47.917 --> 21:49.750
"Can I make it to
the door in time?"

22:02.000 --> 22:03.541
- Hey.
- Kirsten.

22:03.542 --> 22:05.833
Where is Matt?

22:06.500 --> 22:07.832
Uh, he said he had to go Uptown,

22:07.833 --> 22:09.332
- pick up a report.
- What report?

22:09.333 --> 22:12.582
To be honest, the kid's kind of
on my shit list right now, so...

22:12.583 --> 22:15.707
You know, Cherry, I never thought that
you'd be the one hiding things from me.

22:15.708 --> 22:18.166
- Kirsten...
- Matt has got a ton on his plate,

22:18.167 --> 22:19.499
and yet, every time I see him,

22:19.500 --> 22:21.957
he's in some kind of private
conversation with you.

22:21.958 --> 22:23.957
What do you want me to say?

22:23.958 --> 22:26.457
The same confidence I
give Matt, I give to you.

22:26.458 --> 22:30.583
See, that doesn't work
for me! We're a team here,

22:31.667 --> 22:34.207
and hiding things from one another
isn't gonna get us anywhere.

22:34.208 --> 22:36.250
I trust you, and I trust Matt.

22:38.333 --> 22:40.292
Be nice if that was
a two-way street.

22:55.292 --> 22:57.708
...the battery suspect is...

23:34.125 --> 23:35.208
Same.

23:46.208 --> 23:47.208
Oh, Christ.

23:47.875 --> 23:48.917
Hey!

23:50.958 --> 23:52.333
Shit!

24:01.417 --> 24:02.666
Are you sure it was him?

24:02.667 --> 24:04.375
<i>Well, yeah. As far
as I could tell.</i>

24:05.292 --> 24:08.416
Look, the facial recognition
ID'd the sketch as Heather Glenn,

24:08.417 --> 24:10.167
<i>a psychiatrist downtown.</i>

24:15.375 --> 24:16.999
Yeah, I'll... I'll
put out an APB.

24:17.000 --> 24:21.167
No! Don't. The Task
Force can handle this.

24:22.208 --> 24:25.332
You are the thin, dark
line protecting this city.

24:25.333 --> 24:27.625
<i>Remind them of that.</i>

24:28.208 --> 24:31.833
- And don't disappoint me, Powell.
<i>- I won't, sir. None of us will.</i>

24:49.083 --> 24:51.000
Bastian, what are you doing?

24:53.250 --> 24:55.542
My name is Muse.

25:00.708 --> 25:03.791
- Bastian, please.
- Don't fucking call me that!

25:03.792 --> 25:08.667
I am Muse! Muse. M-U-S-E.

25:10.333 --> 25:11.582
It was you.

25:11.583 --> 25:14.208
I read your books.
I've watched you.

25:15.042 --> 25:19.625
You know. You
understand who I am.

25:21.708 --> 25:23.332
Please don't hurt me.

25:23.333 --> 25:25.375
Honestly, I can't
guarantee that.

25:26.208 --> 25:29.875
Muse, where are you
going with all of this?

25:32.458 --> 25:36.292
Please. Please don't.

25:39.000 --> 25:40.999
Please don't.

25:42.417 --> 25:45.458
Please don't.

26:11.542 --> 26:14.208
Please. Please don't do this.

26:15.375 --> 26:16.749
Please don't do this.

26:16.750 --> 26:19.249
Don't you care about all
the people you killed?

26:19.250 --> 26:21.875
Huh? Do you feel nothing?

26:32.542 --> 26:35.750
No. No. Not yet.

26:58.667 --> 27:00.208
What the hell is that?

27:01.417 --> 27:03.417
Oh.

27:08.792 --> 27:10.624
What the fuck are you doing?

27:10.625 --> 27:13.541
You've kidnapped me, and then
you're gonna, what, shoot me? Huh?

27:15.000 --> 27:19.125
Look at you. You can't even talk
to me without that insane mask on!

27:19.875 --> 27:22.417
Anybody who needs
a mask is a coward.

28:08.375 --> 28:12.000
Let's move! Let's move! Go!
I'm goin' in loud in two! Go!

28:19.875 --> 28:21.958
Approaching the North
entrance. Stand by to breach.

28:25.375 --> 28:26.375
Stack up!

29:14.958 --> 29:16.125
Breach.

29:35.000 --> 29:38.666
Heather? Heather.
Heather. Stay... Stay...

29:38.667 --> 29:39.792
It's okay, stay with me.

29:40.708 --> 29:42.917
Stay with me. Stay with me.

29:44.250 --> 29:48.624
Here. Here. It's
all over. Heather.

29:48.625 --> 29:54.166
Hey. Hey. Heather, it's over.

29:58.458 --> 29:59.542
- Breach.
- Yeah.

30:01.500 --> 30:04.666
<i>Secure the scene, we have gained
access. All units, sitrep.</i>

30:04.667 --> 30:06.792
Muse is dead.
Secure the building.

30:07.500 --> 30:10.707
<i>Be advised. There are units outside
waiting for your command. Over.</i>

30:10.708 --> 30:14.208
Roll me a bus ASAP. It looks like
someone has stabilized the victim.

30:15.625 --> 30:20.375
<i>Copy. Two confirming. One down.
One victim in need of EMS.</i>

30:39.500 --> 30:43.167
He had a gun. Part of some
murder-suicide grand plan.

30:44.292 --> 30:47.582
And there's something else, sir.
He wasn't the only one up here.

30:47.583 --> 30:48.708
What do you mean?

30:49.583 --> 30:51.874
When we made entry into the
room, Muse was already dead.

30:51.875 --> 30:54.125
The place was a chaotic mess.

30:55.000 --> 31:00.625
I mean... he was
here. Daredevil.

31:02.042 --> 31:03.708
- Are you sure?
- Positive.

31:17.083 --> 31:22.417
Well, like you said, it was chaotic
up here and hard to see or to tell.

31:23.625 --> 31:26.042
What we do know is that, you
and your men did your job.

31:29.500 --> 31:32.375
That you stopped Muse.

31:34.708 --> 31:37.374
You are heroes.

31:37.375 --> 31:40.250
There was no one else up here.
Isn't that right, Sergeant North?

31:42.917 --> 31:45.458
Yes, it is, Mr. Mayor.
That's right.

31:46.208 --> 31:47.250
Yes.

31:50.250 --> 31:51.375
Imma... go.

32:03.583 --> 32:05.624
<i>I don't know about
what they say they saw,</i>

32:05.625 --> 32:07.082
<i>but I saw Daredevil</i>

32:07.083 --> 32:08.667
<i>go through that window.</i>

32:10.292 --> 32:11.791
Look at you.

32:11.792 --> 32:14.166
You know your boss will
kick your ass for that.

32:14.167 --> 32:16.291
Nah. He's loving me these days.

32:16.292 --> 32:18.624
Besides, he's dealing with
a personal matter tonight.

32:18.625 --> 32:21.625
So, why drag me away
from beers in Bushwick?

32:22.375 --> 32:25.582
New York One and all the majors, they
comb through your blog, don't they?

32:25.583 --> 32:27.707
Of course. 'Cause I
get all the real shit.

32:27.708 --> 32:30.417
Like Daredevil taking out Muse?

32:32.292 --> 32:34.082
You burned me with that
Mayor garbage thing.

32:34.083 --> 32:35.166
Look, you were high.

32:35.167 --> 32:36.767
- You were slipping. I just...
- Shut up.

32:37.792 --> 32:40.541
We're friends, BB, but
I'm not a fuckin' chump,

32:40.542 --> 32:42.374
and you owe me.

32:42.375 --> 32:45.374
The Task Force took out
Muse. Not Daredevil.

32:45.375 --> 32:47.832
Yeah. The one problem with
that is it's bullshit.

32:47.833 --> 32:49.583
You're not stupid, BB.

32:50.458 --> 32:53.083
Mayor Fisk isn't fuckin'
around, and neither am I.

32:54.167 --> 32:57.583
See, this here, this is a
carrot and a stick situation,

32:58.167 --> 33:00.417
with a very big carrot
and a very big stick.

33:03.042 --> 33:04.749
Are you actually...
threatening me?

33:04.750 --> 33:08.249
No, no. I'm presenting
you with an opportunity.

33:08.250 --> 33:10.332
A great one, with a great man,

33:10.333 --> 33:13.416
and what you decide in the
next few seconds will determine

33:13.417 --> 33:18.333
how totally awesome or totally
shitty the rest of your life is.

33:18.917 --> 33:22.417
And I'd be so stoked if you
made the right call. You know?

33:38.333 --> 33:39.417
Matt?

33:42.583 --> 33:43.583
I'm here.

33:47.167 --> 33:49.208
It wasn't a nightmare.

33:49.875 --> 33:51.375
Oh, I'm so sorry.

33:52.958 --> 33:54.875
It's okay.

33:58.292 --> 34:01.832
Listen, the, uh, doctor came by.

34:01.833 --> 34:04.499
Said you have minor
lacerations but no concussion,

34:04.500 --> 34:07.333
so we can take you home, first
thing in the morning, okay?

34:08.917 --> 34:10.292
You're gonna be okay.

34:11.875 --> 34:14.625
- I killed him, Matt.
- You didn't have a choice.

34:18.583 --> 34:19.624
How do you know?

34:19.625 --> 34:23.500
I know. I know
'cause I know you.

34:30.000 --> 34:31.542
There was someone else there.

34:34.625 --> 34:36.625
I mean, right before
Bastian tried to...

34:41.333 --> 34:42.958
And that's when he showed up.

34:45.667 --> 34:46.875
I think.

34:49.625 --> 34:50.625
You think?

34:58.625 --> 35:00.167
I think he said my name.

35:00.917 --> 35:01.917
Who?

35:03.333 --> 35:04.375
Daredevil.

35:10.417 --> 35:11.666
