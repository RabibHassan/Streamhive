01:07:39.555 --> 01:07:41.306
ARTHUR: I don't know.
- Jesus Christ.

01:07:41.473 --> 01:07:43.892
ARTHUR: What happened to you?
- Blocked by a freight train.

01:07:44.059 --> 01:07:46.019
Why put a train
in a downtown intersection?

01:07:46.186 --> 01:07:47.812
- I didn't.
ARTHUR: Where'd it come from?

01:07:47.980 --> 01:07:49.647
Why the hell were we ambushed?

01:07:49.815 --> 01:07:52.233
Those were not normal projections.
They'd been trained, for God's sakes.

01:07:54.320 --> 01:07:55.945
- How could he be trained?
- Fischer's had an extractor...

01:07:56.113 --> 01:08:00.325
...teach his subconscious to defend itself,
so his subconscious is militarized.

01:08:00.492 --> 01:08:02.118
It should've shown in the research.

01:08:02.286 --> 01:08:04.078
COBB: Why the hell didn't it?
- Calm down.

01:08:04.246 --> 01:08:05.580
COBB:
Don't tell me to calm down!

01:08:05.748 --> 01:08:08.666
This was your job, goddamn it!
This was your responsibility!

01:08:08.834 --> 01:08:10.919
You were meant to check
Fischer's background!

01:08:11.086 --> 01:08:14.422
- We are not prepared for this!
- We have dealt with sub-security before!

01:08:14.590 --> 01:08:16.674
We'll be more careful
and we're gonna be fine!

01:08:16.842 --> 01:08:18.676
This was not a part of the plan!
He's dying.

01:08:18.844 --> 01:08:19.886
Put him out his misery.

01:08:20.054 --> 01:08:22.889
- No, don't do that! Don't do that.
- Cobb, hey, hey.

01:08:23.057 --> 01:08:25.183
He's in agony. I'm waking him up.

01:08:25.351 --> 01:08:27.226
No. It won't wake him up.

01:08:27.394 --> 01:08:31.022
What do you mean, it won't wake him up?
When we die in a dream, we wake up.

01:08:31.190 --> 01:08:32.440
Not from this.

01:08:32.608 --> 01:08:35.151
We're too heavily sedated
to wake up that way.

01:08:35.736 --> 01:08:37.445
Right. So, what happens when we die?

01:08:37.613 --> 01:08:39.447
- We drop into limbo.
- Are you serious?

01:08:39.615 --> 01:08:42.158
- Limbo?
ARTHUR: Unconstructed dream space.

01:08:42.326 --> 01:08:45.578
ARIADNE: What the hell is down there?
- Just raw, infinite subconscious.

01:08:45.746 --> 01:08:48.957
Nothing is down there, except for
what might have been left behind...

01:08:49.124 --> 01:08:52.043
...by anyone sharing the dream
who's been trapped there before.

01:08:52.211 --> 01:08:54.087
Which, in our case, is just you.

01:08:54.254 --> 01:08:56.965
- How long could we be stuck?
YUSUF: Can't even think about...

01:08:57.132 --> 01:08:59.550
...trying to escape until the sedation...
- How long?

01:08:59.718 --> 01:09:02.929
Decades. It could be infinite.
Ask him, he's the one who's been there.

01:09:03.097 --> 01:09:04.305
ARTHUR:
Let's get him upstairs.

01:09:04.473 --> 01:09:05.765
[GROANING]

01:09:05.933 --> 01:09:07.392
Great.

01:09:08.394 --> 01:09:09.894
Thank you.

01:09:10.562 --> 01:09:13.815
So now we're trapped in Fischer's mind,
battling his own private army.

01:09:13.983 --> 01:09:15.441
And if we get killed...

01:09:15.609 --> 01:09:18.861
...we'll be lost in limbo till our brains
turn to scrambled egg, hmm?

01:09:25.744 --> 01:09:27.578
ARTHUR:
Someone got first aid?

01:09:29.832 --> 01:09:33.292
- You knew these risks and didn't tell us?
- There weren't meant to be risks.

01:09:33.460 --> 01:09:36.421
- I didn't know we'd be dealing with gunfire.
- You had no right.

01:09:36.588 --> 01:09:38.923
This was the only way
to go three layers deep.

01:09:39.091 --> 01:09:41.092
You knew about this
and went along with it?

01:09:41.260 --> 01:09:42.301
I trusted him.

01:09:42.469 --> 01:09:44.387
When? When he promised you
half his share?

01:09:44.555 --> 01:09:47.807
No. His whole share.
Besides, he said he'd done it before.

01:09:47.975 --> 01:09:50.059
What, with Mal?
Because that worked so good?

01:09:50.227 --> 01:09:53.646
That has nothing to do with it.
I did what I had to to get to my children.

01:09:53.814 --> 01:09:55.732
You led us into a war zone
with no way out?

01:09:55.899 --> 01:09:59.944
There is a way out. We continue on with
the job, and we do it as fast as possible...

01:10:00.112 --> 01:10:02.447
...and we get out using the kick,
just like before.

01:10:02.614 --> 01:10:05.074
Forget it. We go any deeper,
we just raise the stakes.

01:10:05.242 --> 01:10:07.118
I am sitting this one out on this level.

01:10:07.286 --> 01:10:09.704
COBB: Fischer's security
is surrounding this place.

01:10:09.872 --> 01:10:12.123
Ten hours of flight time
is a week at this level.

01:10:12.291 --> 01:10:16.044
That means each and every one of us
will be killed. That I can guarantee you.

01:10:16.628 --> 01:10:20.423
We have no other choice but to continue on
and do it as fast as possible.

01:10:22.009 --> 01:10:24.469
Downwards is the only way forwards.

01:10:26.013 --> 01:10:27.138
Get ready.

01:10:27.306 --> 01:10:29.474
You, come on. Let's go shake him up.

01:10:34.354 --> 01:10:37.398
I'm insured against kidnapping
for up to 10 million.

01:10:37.566 --> 01:10:40.485
- This should be very simple.
COBB: Shut up! It won't be.

01:10:40.652 --> 01:10:42.945
ARTHUR: In your father's office,
below the bookshelves...

01:10:43.113 --> 01:10:45.156
...is his personal safe.
We need the combination.

01:10:45.324 --> 01:10:46.365
[SIGHS]

01:10:46.533 --> 01:10:47.950
I don't know any safe.

01:10:48.160 --> 01:10:50.995
COBB: That doesn't mean
you don't know the combination.

01:10:52.664 --> 01:10:53.998
Tell us what it is.

01:10:54.833 --> 01:10:56.584
I don't know.

01:11:01.507 --> 01:11:03.674
We have it on good authority
you do know.

01:11:03.842 --> 01:11:06.177
Yeah? Whose authority?

01:11:07.679 --> 01:11:11.182
- Five hundred dollars, this cost.
EAMES: What's inside it?

01:11:11.433 --> 01:11:15.186
Cash, cards, ID. And this.

01:11:20.234 --> 01:11:21.734
Useful?

01:11:22.486 --> 01:11:23.528
Maybe.

01:11:23.987 --> 01:11:25.780
You're on. You've got an hour.

01:11:26.198 --> 01:11:27.198
An hour?

01:11:28.534 --> 01:11:30.785
I was supposed to have all night
to crack this.

01:11:30.953 --> 01:11:33.538
And Saito wasn't supposed
to be shot in the chest.

01:11:33.705 --> 01:11:36.874
You've got one hour,
now get us something useful, please.

01:11:37.751 --> 01:11:39.252
[SCREAMING]

01:11:39.419 --> 01:11:41.879
- What's that?
- Good authority.

01:11:46.093 --> 01:11:47.802
Uncle Peter.

01:11:48.512 --> 01:11:50.638
Just make them stop.

01:11:50.931 --> 01:11:53.266
- The combination.
- I don't know it.

01:11:53.433 --> 01:11:56.102
- Why does Browning say you do?
- I don't know.

01:11:56.270 --> 01:11:58.729
Just let me talk to him
and I'll find out.

01:12:01.108 --> 01:12:03.818
You have one hour. Start talking.

01:12:05.821 --> 01:12:07.029
FISCHER:
You all right?

01:12:07.197 --> 01:12:08.739
[GROANING]

01:12:08.907 --> 01:12:10.241
You okay?

01:12:13.912 --> 01:12:17.582
Those bastards have had at me
for two days.

01:12:18.250 --> 01:12:20.751
They have someone with access
to your father's office.

01:12:20.919 --> 01:12:22.753
- They're trying to open his safe.
- Yeah.

01:12:22.921 --> 01:12:25.673
They thought I'd know the combination,
but I don't know it.

01:12:25.841 --> 01:12:28.593
- Yeah, well, neither do I, so...
- What?

01:12:29.344 --> 01:12:32.597
Maurice told me that when he passed,
you were the only one able to open it.

01:12:32.764 --> 01:12:35.266
No, he never gave me any combination.

01:12:36.018 --> 01:12:40.146
Maybe he did. I mean, maybe you
just didn't know it was a combination.

01:12:40.314 --> 01:12:41.522
Well, what, then?

01:12:41.690 --> 01:12:44.233
I don't know, some meaningful
combination of numbers...

01:12:44.401 --> 01:12:48.321
...based on your experiences
with Maurice.

01:12:50.032 --> 01:12:53.951
We didn't have very many, uh,
meaningful experiences together.

01:12:54.703 --> 01:12:56.162
Perhaps after your mother died.

01:12:58.832 --> 01:13:01.542
After my mother died,
you know what he told me?

01:13:03.212 --> 01:13:08.174
"Robert,
there's really nothing to be said."

01:13:08.342 --> 01:13:10.676
Oh, well, he was bad with emotion.

01:13:10.844 --> 01:13:13.554
I was 11, Uncle Peter.

01:13:14.306 --> 01:13:17.558
- How's he doing?
- He's in a lot of pain.

01:13:17.726 --> 01:13:21.312
When we get down to the lower levels,
the pain will be less intense.

01:13:21.480 --> 01:13:22.730
And if he dies?

01:13:23.899 --> 01:13:25.358
Worst-case scenario?

01:13:25.525 --> 01:13:28.236
When he wakes up,
his mind is completely gone.

01:13:28.403 --> 01:13:32.490
Cobb, I'll still honor the arrangement.

01:13:32.658 --> 01:13:34.325
COBB:
I appreciate that, Saito.

01:13:34.493 --> 01:13:38.579
But when you wake up, you won't even
remember that we had an arrangement.

01:13:38.747 --> 01:13:40.790
Limbo is gonna become your reality.

01:13:40.958 --> 01:13:44.710
You're gonna be lost down there so long
that you're gonna become an old man.

01:13:45.170 --> 01:13:46.504
Filled with regret?

01:13:47.965 --> 01:13:49.048
Waiting to die alone.

01:13:49.716 --> 01:13:50.841
No.

01:13:51.385 --> 01:13:53.010
I'll come back.

01:13:53.845 --> 01:13:56.514
And we'll be young men together again.

01:14:02.479 --> 01:14:03.521
Breathe.

01:14:03.689 --> 01:14:06.732
These people are gonna kill us
if we don't give them the combination.

01:14:06.900 --> 01:14:08.818
- They just wanna ransom us.
- I heard them.

01:14:08.986 --> 01:14:12.863
They're gonna lock us in that van,
and then drive it into the river.

01:14:13.031 --> 01:14:14.532
All right. What is in the safe?

01:14:15.617 --> 01:14:16.784
Something for you.

01:14:17.411 --> 01:14:21.539
Maurice always said
it was his most precious gift to you.

01:14:22.291 --> 01:14:25.376
- A will.
- Maurice's will is with Port and Dunn.

01:14:25.544 --> 01:14:26.752
That's an alternate.

01:14:26.920 --> 01:14:29.297
This would supersede the other
if you want it to.

01:14:29.464 --> 01:14:32.091
It splits up the component businesses
of Fischer Morrow.

01:14:32.259 --> 01:14:35.970
It'd be the end of the entire empire
as we know it.

01:14:36.138 --> 01:14:38.597
Destroying my whole inheritance?

01:14:40.267 --> 01:14:43.436
- Why would he suggest such a thing?
- I just don't know.

01:14:46.315 --> 01:14:48.274
He loved you, Robert.

01:14:48.859 --> 01:14:50.484
In his own way.

01:14:50.652 --> 01:14:52.445

In his own way.

At the end...

01:14:56.408 --> 01:14:58.743
...he called me in to his deathbed.

01:14:59.244 --> 01:15:01.078
He could barely speak.

01:15:02.164 --> 01:15:06.417
But he took the trouble
to tell me one last thing.

01:15:08.920 --> 01:15:10.546
He pulled me close.

01:15:13.216 --> 01:15:15.301
And I could only make out...

01:15:16.178 --> 01:15:17.595
...one word.

01:15:21.308 --> 01:15:23.267
"Disappointed."

01:15:27.439 --> 01:15:28.773
[SIGHS]

01:15:28.940 --> 01:15:30.107
When were you in limbo?

01:15:31.693 --> 01:15:35.196
You might have the rest of the team
convinced to carry on with this job.

01:15:35.364 --> 01:15:37.740
- But they don't know the truth.
- Truth? What truth?

01:15:37.949 --> 01:15:42.078
The truth that, at any minute, you might
bring a freight train through the wall.

01:15:42.245 --> 01:15:46.290
The truth that Mal is bursting
through your subconscious.

01:15:46.458 --> 01:15:48.876
And the truth that,
as we go deeper into Fischer...

01:15:49.044 --> 01:15:50.836
...we're also going deeper into you.

01:15:51.671 --> 01:15:54.965
And I'm not sure
we're gonna like what we find.

01:15:58.970 --> 01:16:00.429
We were working together.

01:16:00.597 --> 01:16:04.266
We were exploring the concept
of a dream within a dream.

01:16:04.476 --> 01:16:05.726
I kept pushing things.

01:16:05.894 --> 01:16:09.563
I wanted to go deeper and deeper.
I wanted to go further.

01:16:10.065 --> 01:16:14.944
I just didn't understand the concept that
hours could turn into years down there...

01:16:15.112 --> 01:16:17.822
...that we could get trapped so deep...

01:16:18.657 --> 01:16:21.992
...that when we wound up on the shore
of our own subconscious...

01:16:22.577 --> 01:16:25.121
...we lost sight of what was real.

01:16:31.169 --> 01:16:33.754
We created.
We built the world for ourselves.

01:16:35.382 --> 01:16:37.383
We did that for years.

01:16:38.510 --> 01:16:40.511
We built our own world.

01:16:41.847 --> 01:16:43.556
How long were you stuck there?

01:16:44.724 --> 01:16:46.851
Something like 50 years.

01:16:50.230 --> 01:16:51.397
Jesus.

01:16:53.692 --> 01:16:55.025
How could you stand it?

01:16:55.193 --> 01:16:57.945
It wasn't so bad at first,
feeling like gods.

01:16:58.113 --> 01:17:01.157
The problem was knowing
that none of it was real.

01:17:01.324 --> 01:17:05.703
Eventually, it just became impossible
for me to live like that.

01:17:05.871 --> 01:17:07.288
And what about for her?

01:17:10.750 --> 01:17:14.670
She had locked something away,
something deep inside her.

01:17:16.047 --> 01:17:21.302
A truth that she had once known,
but chose to forget.

01:17:24.222 --> 01:17:26.724
Limbo became her reality.

01:17:28.059 --> 01:17:29.894
What happened when you woke up?

01:17:30.395 --> 01:17:34.064
Well, to wake up from that
after years, after decades...

01:17:35.150 --> 01:17:39.653
...to become old souls thrown back
into youth like that?

01:17:40.572 --> 01:17:44.325
I knew something was wrong with her.
She just wouldn't admit it.

01:17:45.702 --> 01:17:47.953
Eventually, she told me the truth.

01:17:48.413 --> 01:17:51.749
She was possessed by an idea.

01:17:51.917 --> 01:17:57.630
This one very simple idea
that changed everything.

01:17:58.757 --> 01:18:01.258
That our world wasn't real.

01:18:02.177 --> 01:18:06.430
